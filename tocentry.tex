\begin{tocentry}

Some journals require a graphical entry for the Table of Contents.
This should be laid out ``print ready'' so that the sizing of the
text is correct.

Inside the \texttt{tocentry} environment, the font used is Helvetica
8\,pt, as required by \emph{Journal of the American Chemical
Society}.

The surrounding frame is 9\,cm by 3.5\,cm, which is the maximum
permitted for  \emph{Journal of the American Chemical Society}
graphical table of content entries. The box will not resize if the
content is too big: instead it will overflow the edge of the box.

This box and the associated title will always be printed on a
separate page at the end of the document.
