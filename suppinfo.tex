    Contour plot showing the effect of backrub sampling on the average wild-type complex score, for increasing numbers of averaged models. As the number of averaged structures N$_{struct}$ is increased along the x-axis, the average total score of the ensemble of modeled wild-type complexes (shown as colored contours in the body of the plot) also increases, as the wild-type complex models are first sorted according to their total scores and included in the averaged ensemble in order of increasing score.
    As the number of backrub sampling steps at which the ensemble is generated increases (along the y-axis), the total score of an ensemble of any number of structures tends to decrease, indicating that flex ddG is able to find lower-energy states (as measured by the Rosetta energy function) as the simulation progresses. However, using only the lowest energy structures does not produce higher correlations with experimental \ddg\ values, as shown in \cref{fig:structs-v-corr-WildTypeComplex-zemu-12-60000-rscript-validated-t14}.

    The average pairwise ensemble RMSD for each ensemble of 50 structures is shown versus increasing backrub sampling steps. Average pairwise RMSD is computed on the mean of all atoms in all residues selected as backrub pivots, superimposed onto the last output structure in the trajectory. For all analyzed subsets, including the complete dataset, pairwise ensemble RMSD increases with increasing backrub sampling steps, indicating that the diversity of sampled models (as measured by RMSD) continues to increase past the point around 30k-35k sampling steps where correlation with experimental \ddg\ values levels out.

%     As mean backrub ensemble RMSD increases (\cref{fig:t14-mean-ensemble}), we do not see any significant change in Spearman rank-order correlation between mean ensemble RMSD and ddG error (y-axis), as backrub steps increase (x-axis).
%     This demonstrates that mean pairwise backrub ensemble RMSD might not be an effective metric to measure the degree to which we have sampled ``enough''.

Top: Control (no backrub) predictions. Middle: Flex ddG run with the Talaris energy function for 30,000 backrub steps with kT=1.2, averaged over 50 output scores. Bottom: Flex ddG run with the REF energy function, also for 30,000 backrub steps with kT=1.2, averaged over 50 output scores. The GAM is able to reduce the number of outlier flex ddG predictions, particularly relatively neutral values that Rosetta predicts to be highly destabilizing. This improvement in performance is most likely due to the ability of the sigmoid member functions of the GAM to limit extreme score term values once they are no longer predictive.

    Total \ddg\ predictions and partial Rosetta score terms (talaris energy function). On the far left, total scores for the original Rosetta predictions are shown in green alongside GAM-fit predictions in orange and the experimentally determined values in blue. On the far right, the error ($\Delta\Delta G_{predicted} - \Delta\Delta G_{experimental}$) is shown. Intermediate strips show the 7 partial Rosetta score terms (fa\_sol, hbond\_sc, hbond\_bb\_sc, hbond\_lr\_bb, fa\_rep, fa\_elec, and fa\_atr) which together equal the total \ddg\ score on the far left.
    Points shown are filtered from the complete prediction set according to the following criteria: neutral mutations are removed (-1.0 $<$ experimental \ddg\ or Rosetta predicted \ddg\ score $<$ 1.0). Also removed are points where the absolute value of the error of the original Rosetta prediction is less than 2.0
