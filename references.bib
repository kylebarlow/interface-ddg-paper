	abstract = {Protein–protein recognition, frequently mediated by members of large families of interaction domains, is one of the cornerstones of biological function. Here, we present a computational, structure-based method to predict the sequence space of peptides recognized by {PDZ} domains, one of the largest families of recognition proteins. As a test set, we use a considerable amount of recent phage display data that describe the peptide recognition preferences for 169 naturally occurring and engineered {PDZ} domains. For both wild-type {PDZ} domains and single point mutants, we find that 70–80\% of the most frequently observed amino acids by phage display are predicted within the top five ranked amino acids. Phage display frequently identified recognition preferences for amino acids different from those present in the original crystal structure. Notably, in about half of these cases, our algorithm correctly captures these preferences, indicating that it can predict mutations that increase binding affinity relative to the starting structure. We also find that we can computationally recapitulate specificity changes upon mutation, a key test for successful forward design of protein–protein interface specificity. Across all evaluated data sets, we find that incorporation backbone sampling improves accuracy substantially, irrespective of using a crystal or {NMR} structure as the starting conformation. Finally, we report successful prediction of several amino acid specificity changes from blind tests in the {DREAM}4 peptide recognition domain specificity prediction challenge. Because the foundational methods developed here are structure based, these results suggest that the approach can be more generally applied to specificity prediction and redesign of other protein–protein interfaces that have structural information but lack phage display data.},

	abstract = {Author Summary   Designing new protein–ligand interactions has tremendous potential for engineering sensitive biosensors for diagnostics or new enzymes useful in biotechnology, but these applications are extremely challenging, both because of inaccuracies of the energy functions used in modeling and design, and because protein active and binding sites are highly sensitive to subtle changes in structure. Here we describe a new method that addresses the second problem and couples changes in the structure of the protein backbone and of the amino acid side chains, the amino acid sequence, and the conformation of the ligand and its orientation in the binding site. We show that our method improvements significantly increase the accuracy of designing protein–ligand interactions compared to current state-of-the-art design methods. We assess these improvements in two important tests: the first predicts mutations that change ligand-binding preferences in enzymes, and the second predicts protein sequences that bind a given ligand. In these tests, subtle conformational changes made in our model are essential to recapitulate both the results from engineering experiments and the sequence diversity occurring in natural protein families. These results therefore shed light on the mechanisms of how new protein functions might have emerged and can be engineered in the laboratory.},

	abstract = {The development and validation of computational macromolecular modeling and design methods depend on suitable benchmark datasets and informative metrics for comparing protocols. In addition, if a method is intended to be adopted broadly in diverse biological applications, there needs to be information on appropriate parameters for each protocol, as well as metrics describing the expected accuracy compared to experimental data. In certain disciplines, there exist established benchmarks and public resources where experts in a particular methodology are encouraged to supply their most efficient implementation of each particular benchmark. We aim to provide such a resource for protocols in macromolecular modeling and design. We present a freely accessible web resource ( https://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/benchmarks ) to guide the development of protocols for protein modeling and design. The site provides benchmark datasets and metrics to compare the performance of a variety of modeling protocols using different computational sampling methods and energy functions, providing a “best practice” set of parameters for each method. Each benchmark has an associated downloadable benchmark capture archive containing the input files, analysis scripts, and tutorials for running the benchmark. The captures may be run with any suitable modeling method; we supply command lines for running the benchmarks using the Rosetta software suite. We have compiled initial benchmarks for the resource spanning three key areas: prediction of energetic effects of mutations, protein design, and protein structure prediction, each with associated state-of-the-art modeling protocols. With the help of the wider macromolecular modeling community, we hope to expand the variety of benchmarks included on the website and continue to evaluate new iterations of current methods as they become available.},

	abstract = {Substitution mutations in protein–protein interfaces can have a substantial effect on binding, which has consequences in basic and applied biomedical research. Experimental expression, purification, and affinity determination of protein complexes is an expensive and time-consuming means of evaluating the effect of mutations, making a fast and accurate in silico method highly desirable. When the structure of the wild-type complex is known, it is possible to economically evaluate the effect of point mutations with knowledge based potentials, which do not model backbone flexibility, but these have been validated only for single mutants. Substitution mutations tend to induce local conformational rearrangements only. Accordingly, {ZEMu} (Zone Equilibration of Mutants) flexibilizes only a small region around the site of mutation, then computes its dynamics under a physics-based force field. We validate with 1254 experimental mutants (with 1–15 simultaneous substitutions) in a wide variety of different protein environments (65 protein complexes), and obtain a significant improvement in the accuracy of predicted ΔΔG.

	abstract = {Predicting the set of sequences that are tolerated by a protein or protein interface, while maintaining a desired function, is useful for characterizing protein interaction specificity and for computationally designing sequence libraries to engineer proteins with new functions. Here we provide a general method, a detailed set of protocols, and several benchmarks and analyses for estimating tolerated sequences using flexible backbone protein design implemented in the Rosetta molecular modeling software suite. The input to the method is at least one experimentally determined three-dimensional protein structure or high-quality model. The starting structure(s) are expanded or refined into a conformational ensemble using Monte Carlo simulations consisting of backrub backbone and side chain moves in Rosetta. The method then uses a combination of simulated annealing and genetic algorithm optimization methods to enrich for low-energy sequences for the individual members of the ensemble. To emphasize certain functional requirements (e.g. forming a binding interface), interactions between and within parts of the structure (e.g. domains) can be reweighted in the scoring function. Results from each backbone structure are merged together to create a single estimate for the tolerated sequence space. We provide an extensive description of the protocol and its parameters, all source code, example analysis scripts and three tests applying this method to finding sequences predicted to stabilize proteins or protein interfaces. The generality of this method makes many other applications possible, for example stabilizing interactions with small molecules, {DNA}, or {RNA}. Through the use of within-domain reweighting and/or multistate design, it may also be possible to use this method to find sequences that stabilize particular protein conformations or binding interactions over others.},

In principle, given the structure of a wild-type protein and a point mutation whose effects are to be predicted, an accurate method should recapitulate both the structural changes and the change in the folding-free energy. Here, we explore the performance of protocols which sample an increasing diversity of conformations. We find that surprisingly similar performances in predicting changes in stability are achieved using protocols that involve very different amounts of conformational sampling, provided that the resolution of the force field is matched to the resolution of the sampling method. Methods involving backbone sampling can in some cases closely recapitulate the structural changes accompanying mutations but not surprisingly tend to do more harm than good in cases where structural changes are negligible. Analysis of the outliers in the stability change calculations suggests areas needing particular improvement; these include the balance between desolvation and the formation of favorable buried polar interactions, and unfolded state modeling.

Results: We present {SKEMPI}, a database of 3047 binding free energy changes upon mutation assembled from the scientific literature, for protein–protein heterodimeric complexes with experimentally determined structures. This represents over four times more data than previously collected. Changes in 713 association and dissociation rates and 127 enthalpies and entropies were also recorded. The existence of biases towards specific mutations, residues, interfaces, proteins and protein families is discussed in the context of how the data can be used to construct predictive models. Finally, a cross-validation scheme is presented which is capable of estimating the efficacy of derived models on future data in which these biases are not present.

However, it is currently unclear what characteristics of backbone ensembles are required for the accurate prediction of protein sequence stability. In this study, we aimed to improve the accuracy of protein stability predictions made with {MSD} by using a variety of backbone ensembles to recapitulate the experimentally measured stability of 85 Streptococcal protein G domain β1 sequences. Ensembles tested here include an {NMR} ensemble as well as those generated by molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations, by Backrub motions, and by {PertMin}, a new method that we developed involving the perturbation of atomic coordinates followed by energy minimization. {MSD} with the {PertMin} ensembles resulted in the most accurate predictions by providing the highest number of stable sequences in the top 25, and by correctly binning sequences as stable or unstable with the highest success rate (≈90\%) and the lowest number of false positives. The performance of {PertMin} ensembles is due to the fact that their members closely resemble the input crystal structure and have low potential energy. Conversely, the {NMR} ensemble as well as those generated by {MD} simulations at 500 or 1000 K reduced prediction accuracy due to their low structural similarity to the crystal structure. The ensembles tested herein thus represent on- or off-target models of the native protein fold and could be used in future studies to design for desired properties other than stability.

                    mutations in protein complexes relies not only on the performance of
                    computational methods but also on the availability and quality of experimental
                    data. Binding affinity changes can be measured by various experimental methods
                    with different accuracies and limitations. To understand the impact of these on
                    the prediction of binding affinity change, we present the Database of binding
                    Affinity Change Upon Mutation ({DACUM}), a database of 1872 binding affinity
                    changes upon single-point mutations, a subset of the {SKEMPI} database (Moal,I.H.
                    and Fernández-Recio,J. Bioinformatics, 2012;28:2600–2607) extended with
                    information on the experimental methods used for ΔΔG measurements. The ΔΔG data were classified into different data
                    sets based on the experimental method used and the position of the mutation
                    (interface and non-interface). We tested the prediction performance of the
                    original {HADDOCK} score, a newly trained version of it and mutation Cutoff

                    2014;30:335–342), one of the best reported ΔΔG predictors so
                    far, on these various data sets. Our results demonstrate a strong impact of the

This “backrub” motion provides an influential and common type of local plasticity in protein backbone. Concerted reorientation of two adjacent peptides swings the central sidechain perpendicular to the chain direction, changing accessible sidechain conformations while leaving flanking structure undisturbed. Alternate conformations in sub-1 Å crystal structures show backrub motions for two-thirds of the significant Cβ shifts and 3\% of the total residues in these proteins (126/3882), accompanied by two-state changes in sidechain rotamer. The Backrub modeling tool is effective in crystallographic rebuilding. For homology modeling or protein redesign, backrubs can provide realistic, small perturbations to rigid backbones. For large sidechain changes in protein dynamics or for single mutations, backrubs allow backbone accommodation while maintaining H bonds and ideal geometry.},

One key property of proteins is their flexibility—their intrinsic ability to adopt different conformations. This flexibility can be measured experimentally but the measurements are indirect and computational models are required to interpret them. Here we develop a new computational method for interpreting these measurements of flexibility and use it to create a model of flexibility of the protein ubiquitin. We apply our results to show relationships between the flexibility of one protein and the diversity of structures and amino acid sequences of the protein's evolutionary family. Thus, our results show that more accurate computational modeling of protein flexibility is useful for improving prediction of a broader range of amino acid sequences compatible with a given protein. Our method will be helpful for advancing methods to rationally engineer protein functions by enabling sampling of conformational and sequence diversity similar to that of a protein's evolutionary family.},

One reason for design failures is conformational plasticity, as proteins frequently change their conformation in response to mutations. To advance protein design, here we describe a method employing flexible backbone ensembles to predict sequences tolerated for a protein-protein interface. We show that the predictions are enriched in functional proteins when compared to a phage display screen quantitatively mapping the energy landscape for the interaction between human growth hormone and its receptor. Our model for structural plasticity is inspired by coupled side chain-backbone “backrub” motions observed in high-resolution protein crystal structures. Although the modeled structural changes are subtle, our results on predicting sequence plasticity suggest that backrub sampling may capture a sizable fraction of localized conformational changes that occur in proteins. The described method has implications for predicting sequence libraries to enable challenging protein engineering problems.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Mutations in homologous proteins affect changes in the backbone conformation that involve a complex interplay of forces which are difficult to predict. Protein design algorithms need to anticipate these backbone changes in order to accurately calculate the energy of the structure given an amino acid sequence, without knowledge of the final, designed sequence. This is related to the problem of predicting small changes in the backbone between highly similar sequences. Results: We explored the ability of the Rosetta suite of protein design tools to move the backbone from its position in one structure (template) to its position in a close homologous structure (target) as a function of the diversity of a backbone ensemble constructed using the template structure, the percent sequence identity between the template and target, and the size of local zone being considered in the ensemble. We describe a pareto front in the likelihood of moving the backbone toward the target as a function of ensemble diversity and zone size. The equations and protocols presented here will be useful for protein design.

	abstract = {Accurate modeling of biomolecular systems requires accurate forcefields. Widely used molecular mechanics ({MM}) forcefields obtain parameters from experimental data and quantum chemistry calculations on small molecules but do not have a clear way to take advantage of the information in high-resolution macromolecular structures. In contrast, knowledge-based methods largely ignore the physical chemistry of interatomic interactions, and instead derive parameters almost exclusively from macromolecular structures. This can involve considerable double counting of the same physical interactions. Here, we describe a method for forcefield improvement that combines the strengths of the two approaches. We use this method to improve the Rosetta all-atom forcefield, in which the total energy is expressed as the sum of terms representing different physical interactions as in {MM} forcefields and the parameters are tuned to reproduce the properties of macromolecular structures. To resolve inaccuracies resulting from possible double counting of interactions, we compare distribution functions from low-energy modeled structures to those from crystal structures. The structural and physical bases of the deviations between the modeled and reference structures are identified and used to guide forcefield improvements. We describe improvements resolving double counting between backbone hydrogen bond interactions and Lennard-Jones interactions in helices; between sidechain-backbone hydrogen bonds and the backbone torsion potential; and between the sidechain torsion potential and Lennard-Jones interactions. Discrepancies between computed and observed distributions are also used to guide the incorporation of an explicit Cα-hydrogen bond in β sheets. The method can be used generally to integrate different sources of information for forcefield improvement. Proteins 2011; © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This paper describes the mathematical models and physical concepts that underlie the latest Rosetta energy function, called the Rosetta Energy Function 2015 ({REF}15). Applying these concepts, we explain how to use Rosetta energies to identify and analyze the features of biomolecular models.
