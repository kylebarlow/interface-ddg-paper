	abstract = {The study of protein aggregation saw a renaissance in the last decade, when it was discovered that aggregation is the cause of several human diseases, making this field of research one of the most exciting frontiers in science today. Building on knowledge about protein folding energy landscapes, determined using an array of biophysical methods, theory and simulation, new light is now being shed on some of the key questions in protein-misfolding diseases. This review will focus on the mechanisms of protein folding and amyloid fibril formation, concentrating on the role of partially folded states in these processes, the complexity of the free energy landscape, and the potentials for the development of future therapeutic strategies based on a full biophysical description of the combined folding and aggregation free-energy surface.},

Here, we introduce a kinetic algorithm, {CRISP}, that greatly enhances the sampling efficiency in all-atom {MC} simulations of dense systems. The algorithm is based on an exact analytical solution to the classic chain-closure problem, making it possible to express the interdependencies among degrees of freedom in the molecule as correlations in a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate that our method reproduces structural variation in proteins with greater efficiency than current state-of-the-art Monte Carlo methods and has real-time simulation performance on par with molecular dynamics simulations. The presented results suggest our method as a valuable tool in the study of molecules in atomic detail, offering a potential alternative to molecular dynamics for probing long time-scale conformational transitions.},

The junctions between segments are regularized using a loop closure method combining fragment superposition with gradient-based minimization. The energies of the resulting models are optimized by all-atom refinement, and the most representative low-energy model is selected.

The factors governing their affinity remain however elusive, especially when it comes to describing dissociation rates (koff). Here we demonstrate that, next to direct contributions from the interface, also the non-interacting surface plays an important role in binding affinity, especially polar and charged residues. Their percentage on the non-interacting surface is conserved over orthologous complexes indicating an evolutionary selection pressure. Their effect on binding affinity can be explained by long-range electrostatics contributions and surface-solvent interactions that are known to determine the local frustration of the protein complex surface. Including these in a simple model significantly improves the affinity prediction of protein complexes from structural models. The impact of mutations outside the interacting surface on binding affinity is supported by experimental alanine scanning mutagenesis data. These results enable the development of more sophisticated and integrated biophysical models of binding affinity and open new directions in experimental control and modulation of biomolecular interactions.},

This review highlights recent successes in applying new or improved protein engineering strategies toward the design of improved enzymes and enzymes with new activities. We focus on three approaches: structure-guided protein design, computational design, and the use of novel scaffolding and compartmentalization techniques to improve performance of multienzyme systems. Examples described address problems relating to enzyme specificity, stability, and/or activity, or aim to balance sequential reactions and route intermediates by co-localizing multiple enzymes. Specific applications include improving production of biofuels using enzymes with altered cofactor specificity, production of high-value chiral compounds by enzymes with tailored substrate specificities, and accelerated cellulose degradation via multi-enzyme scaffold assemblies. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a growing variety of computational and molecular biology tools. Continued advances on these fronts coupled with better mindfulness of how to apply proteins in unique ways offer exciting prospects for future protein engineering and biocatalysis research.

After analyses of codon content and relative synonymous codon usages were checked by the Bonferroni correction, we found five codons, with three ({AUA}, {AGA}, and {AGG}) correlating positively and two ({CGU} and {AGC}) correlating negatively with the Topt value. The three positive codons are purine-rich codons, and the two negative codons have A-ends. The two negative codons are pyridine-rich codons, and one has a C-end. Comparable with the codon C- and A-ending features, C- and A-content within {mRNA} correlated negatively and positively with the Topt value, respectively. Thereby, codons have effects on enzyme thermal property. When the issue is analyzed at the residual level, the effect of codon message is lost.

	abstract = {There have been considerable attempts in the past to relate phenotypic trait—habitat temperature of organisms—to their genotypes, most importantly compositions of their genomes and proteomes. However, despite accumulation of anecdotal evidence, an exact and conclusive relationship between the former and the latter has been elusive. We present an exhaustive study of the relationship between amino acid composition of proteomes, nucleotide composition of {DNA}, and optimal growth temperature ({OGT}) of prokaryotes. Based on 204 complete proteomes of archaea and bacteria spanning the temperature range from ?10 °C to 110 °C, we performed an exhaustive enumeration of all possible sets of amino acids and found a set of amino acids whose total fraction in a proteome is correlated, to a remarkable extent, with the {OGT}. The universal set is Ile, Val, Tyr, Trp, Arg, Glu, Leu ({IVYWREL}), and the correlation coefficient is as high as 0.93. We also found that the G + C content in 204 complete genomes does not exhibit a significant correlation with {OGT} (R = ?0.10). On the other hand, the fraction of A + G in coding {DNA} is correlated with temperature, to a considerable extent, due to codon patterns of {IVYWREL} amino acids. Further, we found strong and independent correlation between {OGT} and the frequency with which pairs of A and G nucleotides appear as nearest neighbors in genome sequences. This adaptation is achieved via codon bias. These findings present a direct link between principles of proteins structure and stability and evolutionary mechanisms of thermophylic adaptation. On the nucleotide level, the analysis provides an example of how nature utilizes codon bias for evolutionary adaptation to extreme conditions. Together these results provide a complete picture of how compositions of proteomes and genomes in prokaryotes adjust to the extreme conditions of the environment.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional lattice model of a protein is used to investigate the properties required for its folding to the native state. The polypeptide chain is represented as a 27 bead heteropolymer whose lowest energy (native) state can be determined by an exhaustive enumeration of all fully compact conformations. A total of 260 sequences with random interactions are generated and subjected to Monte Carlo simulations to determine which chains find the ground state in a short time; i.e. which sequences overcome the folding problem referred to as the Levinthal paradox. Comparison of the folding and non-folding sequences is used to identify the features that are required for fast folding to the global energy minimum. It is shown that successful folding does not require certain attributes that have been previously proposed as necessary for folding; these include a high number of short versus long-range contacts in the native state, a high content of the secondary structure in the native state, a strong correlation between the native contact map and the interaction parameters, and the existence of a high number of low energy states with near-native conformation. Instead, the essential difference between the folding and the non-folding sequences is the nature of the energy spectrum. The necessary and sufficient condition for a sequence to fold rapidly in the present model is that the native state is a pronounced energy minimum. As a consequence, the thermodynamic stability of the native state of a folding sequence has a sigmoidal dependence on temperature. This permits such a sequence to satisfy both the thermodynamic and the kinetic requirements for folding; i.e. the native state predominates thermodynamically at temperatures that are high enough for folding to be kinetically possible. The applicability of the present results to real proteins is discussed.},

These fundamental principles of protein design are manifested in the “from both ends of the hydrophobicity scale” trend observed in thermophilic adaptation, whereby proteomes of thermophilic proteins are enriched in extreme amino acids—hydrophobic and charged—at the expense of polar ones.

The question is then if side-chain charges, due to their desolvation penalties, play a corresponding role in protein folding by avoiding competing, misfolded traps? To find out, we removed all 32 side-chain charges from the 101-residue protein S6 from Thermus thermophilus. The results show that the charge-depleted S6 variant not only retains its native structure and cooperative folding transition, but folds also faster than the wild-type protein. In addition, charge removal unleashes pronounced aggregation on longer timescales. S6 provides thus an example where the bias toward native contacts of a naturally evolved protein sequence is independent of charges, and point at a fundamental difference in the codes for folding and intermolecular interaction: specificity in folding is governed primarily by hydrophobic packing and hydrogen bonding, whereas solubility and binding relies critically on the interplay of side-chain charges.},

Current approaches for designing ligand-binding proteins for medical and biotechnological uses rely on raising antibodies against a target antigen in immunized animals and/or performing laboratory-directed evolution of proteins with an existing low affinity for the desired ligand, neither of which allows complete control over the interactions involved in binding. Here we describe a general computational method for designing pre-organized and shape complementary small-molecule-binding sites, and use it to generate protein binders to the steroid digoxigenin ({DIG}). Of seventeen experimentally characterized designs, two bind {DIG}; the model of the higher affinity binder has the most energetically favourable and pre-organized interface in the design set. A comprehensive binding-fitness landscape of this design, generated by library selections and deep sequencing, was used to optimize its binding affinity to a picomolar level, and X-ray co-crystal structures of two variants show atomic-level agreement with the corresponding computational models. The optimized binder is selective for {DIG} over the related steroids digitoxigenin, progesterone and ?-oestradiol, and this steroid binding preference can be reprogrammed by manipulation of explicitly designed hydrogen-bonding interactions. The computational design method presented here should enable the development of a new generation of biosensors, therapeutics and diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Protein loop closure constitutes a critical step in loop and protein modeling whereby geometrically feasible loops must be found between two given anchor residues. Here, a new analytic/iterative algorithm denoted random coordinate descent ({RCD}) to perform protein loop closure is described. The algorithm solves loop closure through minimization as in cyclic coordinate descent but selects bonds for optimization randomly, updates loop conformations by spinor-matrices, performs loop closure in both chain directions, and uses a set of geometric filters to yield efficient conformational sampling. Geometric filters allow one to detect clashes and constrain dihedral angles on the fly. The {RCD} algorithm is at least comparable to state of the art loop closure algorithms due to an excellent balance between efficiency and intrinsic sampling capability. Furthermore, its efficiency allows one to improve conformational sampling by increasing the sampling number without much penalty. Overall, {RCD} turns out to be accurate, fast, robust, and applicable over a wide range of loop lengths. Because of the versatility of {RCD}, it is a solid alternative for integration with current loop modeling strategies.},

	abstract = {A key component of computational biology is to compare the results of computer modelling with experimental measurements. Despite substantial progress in the models and algorithms used in many areas of computational biology, such comparisons sometimes reveal that the computations are not in quantitative agreement with experimental data. The principle of maximum entropy is a general procedure for constructing probability distributions in the light of new data, making it a natural tool in cases when an initial model provides results that are at odds with experiments. The number of maximum entropy applications in our field has grown steadily in recent years, in areas as diverse as sequence analysis, structural modelling, and neurobiology. In this Perspectives article, we give a broad introduction to the method, in an attempt to encourage its further adoption. The general procedure is explained in the context of a simple example, after which we proceed with a real-world application in the field of molecular simulations, where the maximum entropy procedure has recently provided new insight. Given the limited accuracy of force fields, macromolecular simulations sometimes produce results that are at not in complete and quantitative accordance with experiments. A common solution to this problem is to explicitly ensure agreement between the two by perturbing the potential energy function towards the experimental data. So far, a general consensus for how such perturbations should be implemented has been lacking. Three very recent papers have explored this problem using the maximum entropy approach, providing both new theoretical and practical insights to the problem. We highlight each of these contributions in turn and conclude with a discussion on remaining challenges.},

An important aspect of the increased complexity of the folding process in the cellular environment is that proteins tend to be metastable against aggregation, as they are often expressed at levels at which they are poorly soluble. The maintenance of the solubility of the proteome requires the coordinated intervention of a range of quality control mechanisms, which include molecular chaperones, trafficking and degradation pathways, post-translational modifications and transcriptional and translational control. As these regulatory mechanisms should always be active to keep proteins in their soluble state, their impairment upon ageing or environmental stress can lead to the disruption of protein homeostasis resulting in uncontrolled widespread aggregation and disease.},

Each step in protein production has the potential to cause aggregation as proteins, not evolved to exist outside the cell, endure the various steps involved in commercial manufacturing processes. Mechanistic studies into protein aggregation have revealed that certain sequence regions contribute more to the aggregation propensity of a protein than other sequence regions do. Efforts to disrupt these regions have thus far indicated that rational sequence engineering is a useful technique to reduce the aggregation of biotechnologically relevant proteins. To improve our ability to rationally engineer proteins with enhanced expression, solubility, and shelf-life we conducted extensive analyses of aggregation prone regions ({APRs}) within protein sequences to characterize the various roles these regions play in proteins. Findings from this work indicate that protein sequences have evolved by minimizing their aggregation propensities. However, we also found that many {APRs} are conserved in protein families and are essential to maintain protein stability and function. Therefore, the contributions that {APRs}, targeted for disruption, make towards protein stability and function should be carefully evaluated when improving protein solubility via rational design.},

The {ERBIN}-binding site in {ERBB}2/{HER}2 has a critical role in restricting this receptor to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, as mutation of the {ERBIN}-binding site leads to the mislocalization of the receptor in these cells.

Here, we present a computational, structure-based method to predict the sequence space of peptides recognized by {PDZ} domains, one of the largest families of recognition proteins. As a test set, we use a considerable amount of recent phage display data that describe the peptide recognition preferences for 169 naturally occurring and engineered {PDZ} domains. For both wild-type {PDZ} domains and single point mutants, we find that 70–80\% of the most frequently observed amino acids by phage display are predicted within the top five ranked amino acids. Phage display frequently identified recognition preferences for amino acids different from those present in the original crystal structure. Notably, in about half of these cases, our algorithm correctly captures these preferences, indicating that it can predict mutations that increase binding affinity relative to the starting structure. We also find that we can computationally recapitulate specificity changes upon mutation, a key test for successful forward design of protein–protein interface specificity. Across all evaluated data sets, we find that incorporation backbone sampling improves accuracy substantially, irrespective of using a crystal or {NMR} structure as the starting conformation. Finally, we report successful prediction of several amino acid specificity changes from blind tests in the {DREAM}4 peptide recognition domain specificity prediction challenge. Because the foundational methods developed here are structure based, these results suggest that the approach can be more generally applied to specificity prediction and redesign of other protein–protein interfaces that have structural information but lack phage display data.},

In addition, efficient search methods provide a rigorous test of existing energy functions, which are generally knowledge-based and contain different terms added together with arbitrary weights. Here, we test different search methods with one of the most accurate and predictive energy functions, namely Rosetta the knowledge-based force-field from Baker's group [Simons K, Kooperberg C, Huang E, Baker D (1997) J Mol Biol 268:209–225]. We use an implementation of a generalized ensemble search method to scale relevant parts of the energy function. This method, known as Hamiltonian Replica Exchange Monte Carlo, outperforms the original Monte Carlo Simulated Annealing used in the Rosetta package in terms of sampling low-energy states. It also outperforms another widely used generalized ensemble search method known as Temperature Replica Exchange Monte Carlo. Our results reveal clear deficiencies in the low-resolution Rosetta energy function in that the lowest energy structures are not necessarily the most native-like. By using a set of nonnative low-energy structures found by our extensive sampling, we discovered that the long-range and short-range backbone hydrogen-bonding energy terms of the Rosetta energy discriminate between the nonnative and native-like structures significantly better than the low-resolution score used in Rosetta.},

Here, we describe the existence and implications of a molecular clock of folds, a universal recurrence in the discovery of new structures in the world of proteins. Using a phylogenomic structural census in hundreds of proteomes, we build phylogenies and time lines of domains at fold and fold superfamily levels of structural complexity. These time lines correlate approximately linearly with geological timescales and were here used to date two crucial events in life history, planet oxygenation and organism diversification. We first dissected the structures and functions of enzymes in simulated metabolic networks. The placement of anaerobic and aerobic enzymes in the time line revealed that aerobic metabolism emerged about 2.9 billion years (giga-annum; Ga) ago and expanded during a period of about 400 My, reaching what is known as the Great Oxidation Event. During this period, enzymes recruited old and new folds for oxygen-mediated enzymatic activities. Remarkably, the first fold lost by a superkingdom disappeared in Archaea 2.6 Ga ago, within the span of oxygen rise, suggesting that oxygen also triggered diversification of life. The implications of a molecular clock of folds are many and important for the neutral theory of molecular evolution and for understanding the growth and diversity of the protein world. The clock also extends the standard concept that was specific to molecules and their timescales and turns it into a universal timescale-generating tool.},

We show that the Abs\_CO = {CO} × L, is able to predict rather accurately folding rates for both two-state and multistate folding proteins, as well as short peptides, and that this Abs\_CO scales with the protein chain length as L0.70 ± 0.07 for the totality of studied single-domain proteins and peptides.},

A fundamental biological endeavor is to uncover the driving evolutionary forces for discovering and optimizing new folds. A long-standing hypothesis is that fold evolution obeys constraints to properly fold into native structure. We here test this hypothesis by analyzing trends of proteins to fold fast during evolution. Using phylogenomic and structural analyses, we observe an overall decrease in folding times between 3.8 and 1.5 billion years ago, which can be interpreted as an evolutionary optimization for rapid folding. This trend towards fast folding probably resulted in manifold advantages, including high protein accessibility for the cell and a reduction of protein aggregation during misfolding.},

This suggests that many protein interaction surfaces may not be intrinsically “druggable” by small molecules, and elevates in importance the few successful examples as model systems for improving our understanding of factors contributing to druggability. Here we describe a new approach for exploring protein fluctuations leading to surface pockets suitable for small molecule binding. We find that the presence of such pockets is indeed a signature of druggable protein interaction sites, suggesting that “druggability” is a property encoded on a protein surface through its propensity to form pockets. We anticipate that the insights described here will prove useful in selecting protein targets for therapeutic intervention.},

With an increasing amount of studies aiming at detection and validation of imaging biomarkers for this disease, many apparently controversial findings have been reported over the time. The failure of current strategies to provide a consistent explanation for these differential findings motivates the necessity to develop new integrative approaches based on multi-modal data that capture various aspects of disease pathology. In our study we propose such a generative model providing a comprehensive approach towards integration of previously published differential findings in early- and late-onset {AD}. We believe that our analytical strategy not only provides the link between imaging biomarkers and clinical phenotype considering the effects of aging, but could also lead to new areas of research in terms of creation of new, individualized biomarkers for a more accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.},

Differential scanning calorimetry has been used to measure the reversible unfolding transitions for the proteins in both heme oxidation states. Reduction potentials have been measured as a function of temperature for the folded forms of the proteins. The combination of measurements of thermal stability and reduction potential gives three sides of a thermodynamic cycle and allows prediction of the reduction potential of the thermally unfolded state. The free energies of electron binding for the thermally unfolded proteins differ from those expected for a fully unfolded protein, suggesting that residual structure modulates the reduction potential. At temperatures near 50 °C the N52I mutation has a small but significant effect on oxidation state-sensitive structure in the thermally unfolded protein. Inspection of the high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of iso-2 and N52I iso-2 shows that the effects of the N52I mutation and oxidation state on native protein stability are correlated with changes in the mobility of specific polypeptide chain segments and with altered hydrogen bonding involving a conserved water molecule. However, there is no clear explanation of oxidation state or mutation-induced differences in stability of the proteins in terms of observed changes in structure and mobility of the folded forms of the proteins alone.},

However, most computationally designed interfaces fail to form experimentally. This investigation compares five previously described successful de novo interface designs with 158 failures. Both sets of proteins were designed with the molecular modeling program Rosetta. Designs were considered a success if a high-resolution crystal structure of the complex closely matched the design model and the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding was less than 10 ?M. The successes and failures represent a wide variety of interface types and design goals including heterodimers, homodimers, peptide-protein interactions, one-sided designs (i.e., where only one of the proteins was mutated) and two-sided designs. The most striking feature of the successful designs is that they have fewer polar atoms at their interfaces than many of the failed designs. Designs that attempted to create extensive sets of interface-spanning hydrogen bonds resulted in no detectable binding. In contrast, polar atoms make up more than 40\% of the interface area of many natural dimers, and native interfaces often contain extensive hydrogen bonding networks. These results suggest that Rosetta may not be accurately balancing hydrogen bonding and electrostatic energies against desolvation penalties and that design processes may not include sufficient sampling to identify side chains in preordered conformations that can fully satisfy the hydrogen bonding potential of the interface.},

Apoptosis is a conserved cellular pathway that results in the activation of cysteine-aspartyl proteases, or caspases. To dissect the nonredundant roles of the executioner caspase-3, -6, and -7 in orchestrating apoptosis, we have developed an orthogonal protease to selectively activate each isoform in human cells. Our approach uses a split-tobacco etch virus ({TEV}) protease under small-molecule control, which we call the {SNIPer}, with caspase alleles containing genetically encoded {TEV} cleavage sites. These studies reveal that all three caspases are transiently activated but only activation of caspase-3 or -7 is sufficient to induce apoptosis. Proteomic analysis shown here and from others reveals that 20 of the 33 subunits of the 26S proteasome can be cut by caspases, and we demonstrate synergy between proteasome inhibition and dose-dependent caspase activation. We propose a model of proteolytic reciprocal negative regulation with mechanistic implications for the combined clinical use of proteasome inhibitors and proapoptotic drugs.

Inhibitors of Apoptosis Protein ({IAPs}) are guardian ubiquitin ligases that keep classic proapoptotic proteins in check. Systematic identification of additional {IAP} substrates is challenged by the heterogeneity and sheer number of ubiquitinated proteins (\&gt;5,000). Here we report a powerful catalytic tagging tool, the {NEDDylator}, which fuses a {NEDD}8 E2-conjugating enzyme, Ubc12, to the ubiquitin ligase, {XIAP} or {cIAP}1. This permits transfer of the rare ubiquitin homolog {NEDD}8 to the ubiquitin E3 substrates, allowing them to be efficiently purified for {LC}-{MS}/{MS} identification. We have identified \&gt;50 potential {IAP} substrates of both cytosolic and mitochondrial origin that bear hallmark N-terminal {IAP} binding motifs. These substrates include the recently discovered protein phosphatase {PGAM}5, which we show is proteolytically processed, accumulates in cytosol during apoptosis, and sensitizes cells to death. These studies reveal mechanisms and antagonistic partners for specific {IAPs}, and provide a powerful technology for labeling binding partners in transient protein-protein complexes.},

High-level production of non-native isoprenoid products requires that {FPP} flux be diverted from production of sterols to the heterologous metabolic reactions. To do so, expression of the gene encoding squalene synthase ({ERG}9), the first committed step in sterol biosynthesis, was down-regulated by replacing its native promoter with the methionine-repressible {MET}3 promoter. The intracellular levels of {FPP} were then assayed by expressing the gene encoding amorphadiene synthase ({ADS}) and converting the {FPP} to amorphadiene. Under certain culture conditions amorphadiene production increased fivefold upon {ERG}9 repression. With increasing flux to amorphadiene, squalene and ergosterol production each decreased. The levels of these three metabolites were dependent not only upon the level of {ERG}9 repression, but also the timing of its repression relative to the induction of {ADS} and genes responsible for enhancing flux to {FPP}.

The algorithm is based on a hierarchical workflow and can be parallelized on supercomputers with up to 128,000 compute cores with near perfect efficiency. Such scaling behavior is notable, as with Moore's law continuing only in the number of cores per chip, parallelizability is a critical property of new algorithms.

Derived parameters show that natural geometric space of coiled coils is highly restricted and can be represented by “allowed” conformations amidst a potential continuum of conformers. Allowed structures have (1) restricted axial offsets between helices, which differ starkly between parallel and anti-parallel structures; (2) preferred superhelical radii, which depend linearly on the oligomerization state; (3) pronounced radius-dependent a- and d-position amino acid propensities; and (4) discrete angles of rotation of helices about their axes, which are surprisingly independent of oligomerization state or orientation. In all, we estimate the space of designable coiled-coil structures to be reduced at least 160-fold relative to the space of geometrically feasible structures. To extend the benefits of structural parameterization to other systems, we developed a general mathematical framework for parameterizing arbitrary helical structures, which reduces to the Crick parameterization as a special case. The method is successfully validated on a set of non-coiled-coil helical bundles, frequent in channels and transporter proteins, which show significant helix bending but not supercoiling. Programs for coiled-coil parameter fitting and structure generation are provided via a web interface at http://www.gevorggrigoryan.com/cccp/, and code for generalized helical parameterization is available upon request.},

Designing predetermined crystal structures can be subtle given the complexity of proteins and the noncovalent interactions that govern crystallization. De novo protein design provides an approach to engineer highly complex nanoscale molecular structures, and often the positions of atoms can be programmed with sub-Å precision. Herein, a computational approach is presented for the design of proteins that self-assemble in three dimensions to yield macroscopic crystals. A three-helix coiled-coil protein is designed de novo to form a polar, layered, three-dimensional crystal having the P6 space group, which has a “honeycomb-like” structure and hexameric channels that span the crystal. The approach involves: (i) creating an ensemble of crystalline structures consistent with the targeted symmetry; (ii) characterizing this ensemble to identify “designable” structures from minima in the sequence-structure energy landscape and designing sequences for these structures; (iii) experimentally characterizing candidate proteins. A 2.1 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of one such designed protein exhibits sub-Å agreement [backbone root mean square deviation (rmsd)] with the computational model of the crystal. This approach to crystal design has potential applications to the de novo design of nanostructured materials and to the modification of natural proteins to facilitate X-ray crystallographic analysis.},

Essential to its various functions is its ability to bind simultaneously to two different proteins, {FKBP} and {mTOR}. Despite its widespread use, a thorough analysis of the interactions between {FKBP}, rapamycin, and the rapamycin-binding domain of {mTOR}, {FRB}, is lacking. To probe the affinities involved in the formation of the {FKBP}·rapamycin·{FRB} complex, we used fluorescence polarization, surface plasmon resonance, and {NMR} spectroscopy. Analysis of the data shows that rapamycin binds to {FRB} with moderate affinity (Kd = 26 ± 0.8 ?M). The {FKBP}12·rapamycin complex, however, binds to {FRB} 2000-fold more tightly (Kd = 12 ± 0.8 {nM}) than rapamycin alone. No interaction between {FKBP} and {FRB} was detected in the absence of rapamycin. These studies suggest that rapamycin's ability to bind to {FRB}, and by extension to {mTOR}, in the absence of {FKBP} is of little consequence under physiological conditions. Furthermore, protein?protein interactions at the {FKBP}12?{FRB} interface play a role in the stability of the ternary complex.},

	abstract = {Computational protein design aims at constructing novel or improved functions on the structure of a given protein backbone and has important applications in the pharmaceutical and biotechnical industry. The underlying combinatorial side-chain placement ({SCP}) problem consists of choosing a {SCP} for each residue position such that the resulting overall energy is minimum. The choice of the side-chain then also determines the amino acid for this position. Many algorithms for this {NP}\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{{NP}\}\} -hard problem have been proposed in the context of homology modeling, which, however, reach their limits when faced with large protein design instances. In this paper, we propose a new exact method for the {SCP} problem that works well even for large instance sizes as they appear in protein design. Our main contribution is a dedicated branch-and-bound algorithm that combines tight upper and lower bounds resulting from a novel Lagrangian relaxation approach for {SCP}. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms alternative state-of-the-art exact approaches and makes it possible to optimally solve large protein design instances routinely.},

The Human Microbiome Project collected and sequenced ca. 5,000 samples from 18 different body sites, including the airways, gut, skin, oral cavity and vagina. These data allowed the first assessment of significant patterns of co-presence and exclusion among human-associated bacteria. We combined sparse regression with an ensemble of similarity measures to predict microbial relationships within and between body sites. This captured known relationships in the dental plaque, vagina, and gut, and also predicted novel interactions involving members of under-characterized phyla such as {TM}7. We detected relationships necessary for plaque formation and differences in community composition among dominant members of the gut and vaginal microbiomes. Most relationships were strongly niche-specific, with only a few hub microorganisms forming links across multiple body areas. We also found that phylogenetic distance had a strong impact on the interaction type: closely related microorganisms co-occurred within the same niche, whereas most exclusive relationships occurred between more distantly related microorganisms. This establishes both the specific organisms and general principles by which microbial communities associated with healthy humans are assembled and maintained.},

To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, {microRNA} regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

	abstract = {Background 
 Simian hemorrhagic fever virus ({SHFV}) has caused lethal outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease in captive primates, but its distribution in wild primates has remained obscure. Here, we describe the discovery and genetic characterization by direct pyrosequencing of two novel, divergent {SHFV} variants co-infecting a single male red colobus monkey from Kibale National Park, Uganda. 
 
 
 Methodology/Principal Findings 
 The viruses were detected directly from blood plasma using pyrosequencing, without prior virus isolation and with minimal {PCR} amplification. The two new {SHFV} variants, {SHFV}-krc1 and {SHFV}-krc2 are highly divergent from each other (51.9\% nucleotide sequence identity) and from the {SHFV} type strain {LVR} 42-0/M6941 (52.0\% and 51.8\% nucleotide sequence identity, respectively) and demonstrate greater phylogenetic diversity within {SHFV} than has been documented within any other arterivirus. Both new variants nevertheless have the same 3? genomic architecture as the type strain, containing three open reading frames not present in the other arteriviruses. 
 
 
 Conclusions/Significance 
 These results represent the first documentation of {SHFV} in a wild primate and confirm the unusual 3? genetic architecture of {SHFV} relative to the other arteriviruses. They also demonstrate a degree of evolutionary divergence within {SHFV} that is roughly equivalent to the degree of divergence between other arterivirus species. The presence of two such highly divergent {SHFV} variants co-infecting a single individual represents a degree of within-host viral diversity that exceeds what has previously been reported for any arterivirus. These results expand our knowledge of the natural history and diversity of the arteriviruses and underscore the importance of wild primates as reservoirs for novel pathogens.},

However, it remains very challenging to account for backbone conformational changes during docking, and most current methods inherently keep monomer backbones rigid for algorithmic simplicity and computational efficiency. Here we present a reformulation of the Rosetta docking method that incorporates explicit backbone flexibility in protein–protein docking. The new method is based on a “fold-tree” representation of the molecular system, which seamlessly integrates internal torsional degrees of freedom and rigid-body degrees of freedom. Problems with internal flexible regions ranging from one or more loops or hinge regions to all of one or both partners can be readily treated using appropriately constructed fold trees. The explicit treatment of backbone flexibility improves both sampling in the vicinity of the native docked conformation and the energetic discrimination between near-native and incorrect models.},

	abstract = {In protein fold recognition, the main disadvantage of hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) is the employment of large-scale model architectures which require large data sets and high computational resources for training. Also, {HMMs} must consider sequential information about secondary structures of proteins, to improve prediction performance and reduce model parameters. Therefore, we propose a novel method for protein fold recognition based on a hidden Markov model, called a 9-state {HMM}. The method can (i) reduce the number of states using secondary structure information about proteins for each fold and (ii) recognize protein folds more accurately than other {HMMs}.},

We present a new, multilevel approach to beta-sheet structure prediction that circumvents this difficulty by reformulating structure generation in terms of a folding tree. Nonlocal connections in this tree allow us to explicitly sample alternative beta-strand pairings while simultaneously exploring local conformational space using backbone torsion-space moves. An iterative, energy-biased resampling strategy is used to explore the space of beta-strand pairings; we expect that such a strategy will be generally useful for searching large conformational spaces with a high degree of combinatorial complexity.

Imposing the constraint that at the junction of two such units the bond angle between the bonds C??N and C??C is fixed at some prescribed value ? results in a system of three bivariate polynomials in ui ? tan ?i/2 of degree 2 in each variable. The system is analyzed for the existence of common solutions by making use of resultants, determinants of matrices composed of the coefficients of two (or more) polynomials, whose vanishing is a necessary and sufficient condition for the polynomials to have a common root. Two resultants are compared: the classical Sylvester resultant and the Dixon resultant. It is shown that when two of the variables are eliminated in favor of the third, a polynomial of degree 16 results. To each one of its real roots, there is a corresponding common zero of the system. To each such zero, there corresponds a consistent conformation of the chain. The Sylvester method can find these zeros among the eigenvalues of a 24 × 24 matrix. For the Dixon approach, after removing extraneous factors, an optimally sized eigenvalue problem of size 16 × 16 results. Finally, the easy extension to the more general problem of triaxial loop closure is presented and an algorithm for implementing the method on arbitrary chains is given. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Incorporation of effective backbone sampling into protein simulation and design is an important step in increasing the accuracy of computational protein modeling. Recent analysis of high-resolution crystal structures has suggested a new model, termed backrub, to describe localized, hinge-like alternative backbone and side-chain conformations observed in the crystal lattice. The model involves internal backbone rotations about axes between C-alpha atoms. Based on this observation, we have implemented a backrub-inspired sampling method in the Rosetta structure prediction and design program. We evaluate this model of backbone flexibility using three different tests. First, we show that Rosetta backrub simulations recapitulate the correlation between backbone and side-chain conformations in the high-resolution crystal structures upon which the model was based. As a second test of backrub sampling, we show that backbone flexibility improves the accuracy of predicting point-mutant side-chain conformations over fixed backbone rotameric sampling alone. Finally, we show that backrub sampling of triosephosphate isomerase loop 6 can capture the millisecond/microsecond oscillation between the open and closed states observed in solution. Our results suggest that backrub sampling captures a sizable fraction of localized conformational changes that occur in natural proteins. Application of this simple model of backbone motions may significantly improve both protein design and atomistic simulations of localized protein flexibility.},

In our maps, each domain is represented by a point, and the distance between any two points approximates the structural distance between their corresponding domains. We use these maps to study the spatial distributions of properties of proteins, and in particular those of local vicinities in structure space such as structural density and functional diversity. These maps provide a unique broad view of protein space and thus reveal previously undescribed fundamental properties thereof. At the same time, the maps are consistent with previous knowledge (e.g., domains cluster by their {SCOP} class) and organize in a unified, coherent representation previous observation concerning specific protein folds. To investigate the function–structure relationship, we measure the functional diversity (using the Gene Ontology controlled vocabulary) in local structural vicinities. Our most striking finding is that functional diversity varies considerably across structure space: The space has a highly diverse region, and diversity abates when moving away from it. Interestingly, the domains in this region are mostly alpha/beta structures, which are known to be the most ancient proteins. We believe that our unique perspective of structure space will open previously undescribed ways of studying proteins, their evolution, and the relationship between their structure and function.},

As 555 of these orphan enzymes have metabolic pathway neighbours, we developed a global framework that utilizes the pathway and (meta)genomic neighbour information to assign candidate sequences to orphan enzymes. For 131 orphan enzymes (37\% of those for which (meta)genomic neighbours are available), we associate sequences to them using scoring parameters with an estimated accuracy of 70\%, implying functional annotation of 16 345 gene sequences in numerous (meta)genomes. As a case in point, two of these candidate sequences were experimentally validated to encode the predicted activity. In addition, we augmented the currently available genome-scale metabolic models with these new sequence–function associations and were able to expand the models by on average 8\%, with a considerable change in the flux connectivity patterns and improved essentiality prediction.},

Here we describe a new approach to refining protein structure models that focuses sampling in regions most likely to contain errors while allowing the whole structure to relax in a physically realistic all-atom force field. In applications to models produced using nuclear magnetic resonance data and to comparative models based on distant structural homologues, the method can significantly improve the accuracy of the structures in terms of both the backbone conformations and the placement of core side chains. Furthermore, the resulting models satisfy a particularly stringent test: they provide significantly better solutions to the X-ray crystallographic phase problem in molecular replacement trials. Finally, we show that all-atom refinement can produce de novo protein structure predictions that reach the high accuracy required for molecular replacement without any experimental phase information and in the absence of templates suitable for molecular replacement from the Protein Data Bank. These results suggest that the combination of high-resolution structure prediction with state-of-the-art phasing tools may be unexpectedly powerful in phasing crystallographic data for which molecular replacement is hindered by the absence of sufficiently accurate previous models.},

Its action is mediated by the {PYR}/{PYL}/{RCAR} family of {START} proteins, but it remains unclear how these receptors bind {ABA} and, in turn, how hormone binding leads to inhibition of the downstream type 2C protein phosphatase ({PP}2C) effectors. Here we report crystal structures of apo and {ABA}-bound receptors as well as a ternary {PYL}2–{ABA}–{PP}2C complex. The apo receptors contain an open ligand-binding pocket flanked by a gate that closes in response to {ABA} by way of conformational changes in two highly conserved ?-loops that serve as a gate and latch. Moreover, {ABA}-induced closure of the gate creates a surface that enables the receptor to dock into and competitively inhibit the {PP}2C active site. A conserved tryptophan in the {PP}2C inserts directly between the gate and latch, which functions to further lock the receptor in a closed conformation. Together, our results identify a conserved gate–latch–lock mechanism underlying {ABA} signalling.},

The assignment of enzyme function in functionally diverse superfamilies represents a particular challenge, which we address through a combination of computational predictions, enzymology, and structural biology. Here we describe the results of a focused investigation of a group of enzymes in the enolase superfamily that are involved in epimerizing dipeptides. The first members of this group to be functionally characterized were Ala-Glu epimerases in Eschericiha coli and Bacillus subtilis, based on the operon context and enzymological studies; these enzymes are presumed to be involved in peptidoglycan recycling. We have subsequently studied more than 65 related enzymes by computational methods, including homology modeling and metabolite docking, which suggested that many would have divergent specificities;, i.e., they are likely to have different (unknown) biological roles. In addition to the Ala-Phe epimerase specificity reported previously, we describe the prediction and experimental verification of: (i) a new group of presumed Ala-Glu epimerases; (ii) several enzymes with specificity for hydrophobic dipeptides, including one from Cytophaga hutchinsonii that epimerizes D-Ala-D-Ala; and (iii) a small group of enzymes that epimerize cationic dipeptides. Crystal structures for certain of these enzymes further elucidate the structural basis of the specificities. The results highlight the potential of computational methods to guide experimental characterization of enzymes in an automated, large-scale fashion.},

The Encyclopedia of {DNA} Elements ({ENCODE}) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks. The atomic accuracy of the design process was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of active designs embedded in two protein scaffolds, both of which were nearly superimposable on the design model.},

Here we show that structures can be accurately determined without nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) information on the side chains for proteins up to 25 kilodaltons by incorporating backbone chemical shifts, residual dipolar couplings, and amide proton distances into the Rosetta protein structure modeling methodology. These data, which are too sparse for conventional methods, serve only to guide conformational search toward the lowest-energy conformations in the folding landscape; the details of the computed models are determined by the physical chemistry implicit in the Rosetta all-atom energy function. The new method is not hindered by the deuteration required to suppress nuclear relaxation processes for proteins greater than 15 kilodaltons and should enable routine {NMR} structure determination for larger proteins.},

	abstract = {Proteins are inherently plastic molecules, whose function often critically depends on excursions between different molecular conformations (conformers). However, a rigorous understanding of the relation between a protein/'s structure, dynamics and function remains elusive. This is because many of the conformers on its energy landscape are only transiently formed and marginally populated (less than a few per cent of the total number of molecules), so that they cannot be individually characterized by most biophysical tools. Here we study a lysozyme mutant from phage T4 that binds hydrophobic molecules and populates an excited state transiently (about 1?ms) to about 3\% at 25?°C (ref. 5). We show that such binding occurs only via the ground state, and present the atomic-level model of the /`invisible/', excited state obtained using a combined strategy of relaxation-dispersion {NMR} (ref. 6) and {CS}-Rosetta model building that rationalizes this observation. The model was tested using structure-based design calculations identifying point mutants predicted to stabilize the excited state relative to the ground state. In this way a pair of mutations were introduced, inverting the relative populations of the ground and excited states and altering function. Our results suggest a mechanism for the evolution of a protein/'s function by changing the delicate balance between the states on its energy landscape. More generally, they show that our approach can generate and validate models of excited protein states.},

We have systematically investigated the association of multiple types of {ENCODE} data with disease-associated {SNPs} and show that there is significant enrichment for functional {SNPs} among the currently identified associations. This enrichment is strongest when integrating multiple sources of functional information and when highest confidence disease-associated {SNPs} are used. We propose an approach that integrates multiple types of functional data generated by the {ENCODE} Consortium to help identify “functional {SNPs}” that may be associated with the disease phenotype. Our approach generates putative functional annotations for up to 80\% of all previously reported associations. We show that for most associations, the functional {SNP} most strongly supported by experimental evidence is a {SNP} in linkage disequilibrium with the reported association rather than the reported {SNP} itself. Our results show that the experimental data sets generated by the {ENCODE} Consortium can be successfully used to suggest functional hypotheses for variants associated with diseases and other phenotypes.},

However, many laboratories have detected early nonfibrillar amyloid-? oligomers without observing amyloid fibrils, suggesting that a mechanistic revision may be needed. Here we introduce Cys-Cys-amyloid-?1–40, which cannot bind to the latent fluorophore {FlAsH} as a monomer, but can bind {FlAsH} as an nonfibrillar oligomer or as a fibril, rendering the conjugates fluorescent. Through {FlAsH} monitoring of Cys-Cys-amyloid-?1–40 aggregation, we found that amyloid-?1–40 rapidly and efficiently forms spherical oligomers in vitro (85\% yield) that are kinetically competent to slowly convert to amyloid fibrils by a nucleated conformational conversion mechanism. This methodology was used to show that plasmalogen ethanolamine vesicles eliminate the proteotoxicity-associated oligomerization phase of amyloid-? amyloidogenesis while allowing fibril formation, rationalizing how low concentrations of plasmalogen ethanolamine in the brain are epidemiologically linked to Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {The assembly of proteins into large fibrillar aggregates, known as amyloid fibrils, is associated with a number of common and debilitating diseases. In some cases, proteins deposit extracellularly, while in others the aggregation is intracellular. A common feature of these diseases is the presence of aggregates of different sizes, including mature fibrils, small oligomeric precursors, and other less well understood structural forms such as amorphous aggregates. These various species possess distinct biochemical, biophysical, and pathological properties. Here, we detail a number of techniques that can be employed to examine amyloid fibrils and oligomers using a fluorescence-detection system ({FDS}) coupled with the analytical ultracentrifuge. Sedimentation velocity analysis using fluorescence detection is a particularly useful method for resolving the complex heterogeneity present in amyloid systems and can be used to characterize aggregation in exceptional detail. Furthermore, the fluorescence detection module provides a number of particularly attractive features for the analysis of aggregating proteins. It expands the practical range of concentrations of aggregating proteins under study, which is useful for greater insight into the aggregation process. It also enables the assessment of aggregation behavior in complex biological solutions, such as cell lysates, and the assessment of processes that regulate in-cell or extracellular aggregation kinetics. Four methods of fluorescent detection that are compatible with the current generation of {FDS} instrumentation are described: (1) Detection of soluble amyloid fibrils using a covalently bound fluorophore. (2) Detection of amyloid fibrils using an extrinsic dye that emits fluorescence when bound to fibrils. (3) Detection of fluorescently-labeled lipids and their interaction with oligomeric amyloid intermediates. (4) Detection of green fluorescence protein ({GFP}) constructs and their interactions within mammalian cell lysates.},

The aggregated A? is found to be toxic to neurons since cells die when the aggregated A? is added to the cell culture medium. However, target of action of A? to cells is unknown. We have applied the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ({FCS}) technique to study the existence of a receptor or target molecule for the Alzheimer amyloid ?-peptide (A?) in cultured human cerebral cortical neurons. {FCS} measurement of the fluorophore rhodamine-labeled A? (Rh-A?) shows diffusion times: 0.1 ms, 1.1 ms and 5.9 ms. Thus, 0.1 ms corresponds to the unbound Rh-A?, and 1.1 ms and 5.9 ms correspond to slowly diffusing complexes of Rh-A? bound to a kind of receptor or target molecule for A?. Addition of excess non-labeled A? is accompanied by a competitive displacement, showing that the A? binding is specific. Full saturation of the A? binding is obtained at nanomolar concentrations, indicating that the A? binding is of high affinity. The notion that using {FCS} we have found a kind of receptor or target molecule for A? makes an important point that A? kills cells possibly by affecting cell membranes via a receptor or target molecule. This study is of highly significance since it suggests that A? possibly affects neuronal cell membranes of Alzheimer patients via a receptor or target molecule.},

A great deal of attention has focused on amyloid-? as the major pathogenic mechanisms with the ultimate goal of using amyloid-? lowering therapies as an avenue of treatment. Unfortunately, nearly a quarter century later, no tangible progress has been offered, whereas spectacular failure tends to be the most compelling. We have long contended, as has substantial literature, that proteinaceous accumulations are simply downstream and, often, endstage manifestations of disease. Their overall poor correlation with the level of dementia, and their presence in the cognitively intact is evidence that is often ignored as an inconvenient truth. Current research examining amyloid oligomers, therefore, will add copious details to what is, in essence, a reductionist distraction from upstream pleiotrophic processes such as oxidative stress, cell cycle dysfunction, and inflammation. It is now long overdue that the neuroscientists avoid the pitfall of perseverating on “proteinopathies” and recognize that the continued targeting of end stage lesions in the face of repeated failure, or worse, is a losing proposition.},

Each participant provided data from working sessions where they took no breaks, and from working sessions where they took breaks according to their group assignment: microbreaks at their own discretion (control), microbreaks at 20 min intervals, and microbreaks at 40 min intervals. Four main muscle areas were studied: the cervical extensors, the lumbar erector spinae, the upper trapezius/supraspinatus, and the wrist and finger extensors. The authors have previously shown that when computer workers remained seated at their workstation, the muscles performing sustained postural contractions displayed a cyclic trend in the mean frequency ({MNF}) of the {MES} ({McLean} et al., J. Electrophysiol. Kinesiol. 10 (1) (2000) 33). The data provided evidence (p\&lt;0.05) that all microbreak protocols were associated with a higher frequency of {MNF} cycling at the wrist extensors, at the neck when microbreaks were taken by the control and 40 min protocol groups, and at the back when breaks were taken by the 20 and 40 min protocol groups. No significant change in the frequency of {MNF} cycling was noted at the shoulder. It was determined (p\&lt;0.05) that microbreaks had a positive effect on reducing discomfort in all areas studied during computer terminal work, particularly when breaks were taken at 20 min intervals. Finally, microbreaks showed no evidence of a detrimental effect on worker productivity. The underlying cause of {MNF} cycling, and its relationship to the development of discomfort or cumulative trauma disorders remains to be determined.},

The new methods can be directly applied to the design of new enzymes, and the benchmark provides a powerful in silico test for guiding improvements in computational enzyme design.},

	abstract = {Although de novo computational enzyme design has been shown to be feasible, the field is still in its infancy: the kinetic parameters of designed enzymes are still orders of magnitude lower than those of naturally occurring ones. Nonetheless, designed enzymes can be improved by directed evolution, as recently exemplified for the designed Kemp eliminase {KE}07. Random mutagenesis and screening resulted in variants with \&gt; 200-fold higher catalytic efficiency and provided insights about features missing in the designed enzyme. Here we describe the optimization of {KE}70, another designed Kemp eliminase. Amino acid substitutions predicted to improve catalysis in design calculations involving extensive backbone sampling were individually tested. Those proven beneficial were combinatorially incorporated into the originally designed {KE}70 along with random mutations, and the resulting libraries were screened for improved eliminase activity. Nine rounds of mutation and selection resulted in \&gt; 400-fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency of the original {KE}70 design, reflected in both higher kcat values and lower Km values, with the best variants exhibiting kcat/Km values of \&gt; 5 × 104 s? 1 M? 1. The optimized {KE}70 variants were characterized structurally and biochemically, providing insights into the origins of the improvements in catalysis. Three primary contributions were identified: first, the reshaping of the active-site cavity to achieve tighter substrate binding; second, the fine-tuning of electrostatics around the catalytic His-Asp dyad; and, third, the stabilization of the active-site dyad in a conformation optimal for catalysis.},

	abstract = {1.Oxygen consumptions of resting and trilling crickets were measured at various temperatures. Oscillograms taken at comparable temperatures were used to identify the major factors determining the cost of stridulation.2.Species used were Anurogryllus arboreus (mass ?0.4 g), wing stroke rate at 23°C of 71 strokes per s; and Oecanthus celerinictus and O. quadripunctatus , two sibling species, (masses ?0.06 g), wing stroke rates at 23°C of 57 and 38 strokes per s respectively.3.At 23°C the three species have similar total mass-specific metabolism during singing ( \$\$?t V\_O\_2 \$\$ µl·(g·h) -1 ; Table 3) even though their wing stroke rates are different.4. A. arboreus has no change in net singing metabolism with increasing T a ; however, cost per wing stroke decreases slightly. The Oecanthus both increase their net singing costs with increased T a and the cost per wing stroke remains roughly constant. O. quadripunctatus has a cost per wing stroke about 1.6 times O. celerinictus (Tables 1, 3; Fig. 10). A. arboreus does not elevate its thoracic temperature significantly while stridulating and it is doubtful that tree crickets thermoregulate due to their small size.5.The cost of singing in A. arboreus varies from 10 to 16 times resting; in Oecanthus , from 6 to 12 times resting (Table 3).6.Although the two tree cricket species have different wing stroke rates at any common temperature, the number of file teeth struck per s is almost the same; A. arboreus strikes nearly twice as many teeth per s as do either of the tree crickets (Fig. 9).7.The two factors that explain most of the variation in net cost of trilling are the wing stroke rate (Fig. 10) and the number of teeth struck·(wing stroke) -1 . Related factors that merit study are interspecific differences in file tooth depth and angle, wing mass, and wing velocity.8.For three species of crickets and two species of katydids the average net cost of trilling is about 1.5×10 -5 ml O 2 ·(g·wing stroke) -1 (Fig. 10).9.Chirping should be energetically less expensive than trilling, with costs equivalent to the average cost per wing stroke times the total number of wing strokes per time. The latter factor is 10–95\% lower in chirping species than in trillers.10.An estimated daily respiratory energy budget shows calling taking about 56\% of the daily respiratory budget of O. celerinictus and 26\% for A. arboreus (Table 4).},

	abstract = {This article describes a method for solving the geometric closure problem for simplified models of nucleic acid structures by using the constant bond lengths approximation. The resulting chain breakage/closure equations, formulated in the space of variable torsion and bond angles, are easy to solve, and have only two solutions. The analytical simplicity is in contrast with the high complexity of the closure problem in the torsion angle space with at most 16 solutions, which has been dealt with by several authors and was solved analytically by Wu and Deem (J. Chem. Phys. 1999, 111, 6625). The discussion on the choice of variables and associated Jacobians is focussed on the question of how conformational equilibration is affected in Monte Carlo simulations of molecular systems. In addition to the closure of the phosphate backbone, it is necessary to also solve the closure problem for the five-membered flexible furanose sugar ring. Explicit closure equations and the resulting Jacobians are given both for the complete four-variable model of the furanose ring and simulations in the phase-amplitude space of the five-membered ring, which are based on the approximate two-variable model of furanose introduced by Gabb et al. (J. Comput. Chem. 1995, 16, 667). The suggested closure algorithm can be combined with collective variables defined by translations and rotations of the monomeric nucleotide units. In comparison with simple internal coordinate moves, the resulting concerted moves describe local structural changes that have high acceptance rates and enable fast conformational equilibration. Appropriate molecular models are put forward for prospective Monte Carlo simulations of nucleic acids, but can be easily adapted to other biomolecular systems, such as proteins and lipid structures in biological membranes. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Summary
Abscisic acid ({ABA}) controls many physiological processes and mediates adaptive responses to abiotic stresses. The {ABA} signaling mechanisms for abscisic acid receptors {PYR}/{PYL}/{RCAR} ({PYLs}) were reported. However, it remains unclear whether the molecular mechanisms are suitable for other {PYLs}. Here, complex structures of {PYL}3 with (+)-{ABA}, pyrabactin and {HAB}1 are reported. An unexpected trans-homodimer intermediate observed in the crystal is confirmed in solution. {ABA}-bound {PYL}3 greatly promotes the generation of monomeric {PYL}3, which can excessively increase the efficiency of inhibiting {PP}2Cs. Structure-guided biochemical experiments show that Ser195 accounts for the key intermediate. Interestingly, pyrabactin binds to {PYL}3 in a distinct nonproductive mode with gate closure, which sheds light on the design of agonists and antagonists for abscisic acid receptors. According to different conformations of ligand-bound {PYLs}, the {PYLs} family can be divided into three subclasses, among which the trans-dimeric subclass, represented by {PYL}3, reveals a distinct regulatory mechanism.},

	abstract = {The effects of ambient temperature on stridulation (calling song) in males, and phonotaxis in females, were studied in the chirping cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. In the male, temperature had the greatest effect on the syllable and chirp repetition rates. Both increased linearly with increasing temperature between 15 and 24°C; there was no effect of temperature on these temporal properties at higher temperatures (24–33°C). Syllable duration, number of syllables per chirp and dominant frequency remained relatively unaffected by changes in temperature. Stridulation and phonotaxis were temperature coupled because the female at 15, 22 and 30°C responded best to synthetic songs with syllable and chirp repetition rates that matched these temporal properties of the male's calling song at the same temperature. The phonotactic behaviour of the female indicates that certain combinations of temporal properties in the male's calling Song improve the female's response at different temperatures, suggesting the presence of ‘trade-off’ phenomena in phonotaxis and pattern recognition in G. bimaculatus.},

	abstract = {Infections by the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses cause a rapidly fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans for which no approved antivirals are available1. Filovirus entry is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein ({GP}), which attaches viral particles to the cell surface, delivers them to endosomes and catalyses fusion between viral and endosomal membranes2. Additional host factors in the endosomal compartment are probably required for viral membrane fusion; however, despite considerable efforts, these critical host factors have defied molecular identification3, 4, 5. Here we describe a genome-wide haploid genetic screen in human cells to identify host factors required for Ebola virus entry. Our screen uncovered 67 mutations disrupting all six members of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein-sorting ({HOPS}) multisubunit tethering complex, which is involved in the fusion of endosomes to lysosomes6, and 39 independent mutations that disrupt the endo/lysosomal cholesterol transporter protein Niemann–Pick C1 ({NPC}1)7. Cells defective for the {HOPS} complex or {NPC}1 function, including primary fibroblasts derived from human Niemann–Pick type C1 disease patients, are resistant to infection by Ebola virus and Marburg virus, but remain fully susceptible to a suite of unrelated viruses. We show that membrane fusion mediated by filovirus glycoproteins and viral escape from the vesicular compartment require the {NPC}1 protein, independent of its known function in cholesterol transport. Our findings uncover unique features of the entry pathway used by filoviruses and indicate potential antiviral strategies to combat these deadly agents.},

	abstract = {Tumors that display a highly metastatic phenotype contain subpopulations of cells that display characteristics similar to embryonic stem cells. These cells exhibit the ability to undergo self-renewal; slowly replicate to retain a nucleoside analog label, leading to their definition as “label-retaining cells”; express specific surface markers such as {CD}44+/{CD}24–/low and {CD}133; and can give rise to cells of different lineages (i.e., they exhibit multipotency). Based on these characteristics, as well as their demonstrated ability to give rise to tumors in vivo, these cells have been defined as tumor-initiating cells ({TICs}), tumor-propagating cells, or cancer stem cells ({CSCs}). These cells are highly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation and are believed to be responsible for the development of both primary tumors and metastatic lesions at sites distant from the primary tumor. Established cancer cell lines contain {CSCs}, which can be propagated in vitro using defined conditions, to form 3D tumor spheroids. Because the vast majority of studies to identify cancer-associated genes and therapeutic targets use adherent cells grown in 2 dimensions on a plastic substrate, the multicellular composition of these 3D tumor spheroids presents both challenges and opportunities for their imaging and characterization. The authors describe approaches to image and analyze the properties of {CSCs} within 3D tumor spheroids, which can serve as the basis for defining the gene and protein signatures of {CSCs} and to develop therapeutic strategies that will effectively target this critically important population of cells that may be responsible for tumor progression.},

We have proposed that this discrepancy results from the difference between fitness under laboratory culture conditions and the selective pressures in changing environments over evolutionary time scales. Building on our previous work (Mavor et al. 2016), we used deep mutational scanning to determine how twelve new chemicals reveal novel mutational sensitivities of ubiquitin residues. We found sensitization of Lys63 in eight new conditions. In total, our experiments have uncovered a highly sensitizing condition for every position in Ub except Ser57 and Gln62. By determining the Ubiquitin fitness landscape under different chemical constraints, our work helps to resolve the inconsistencies between deep mutational scanning experiments and sequence conservation over evolutionary timescales.},

J Am Chem Soc (2013) 135:12516–12519), and the engineering of the opening and closing of the chaperonin Mm-cpn, an example of a switch between two functional states (Hoersch et al.: Nat Nanotechn (2013) 8:928–932).

	abstract = {Author Summary   Designing new protein–ligand interactions has tremendous potential for engineering sensitive biosensors for diagnostics or new enzymes useful in biotechnology, but these applications are extremely challenging, both because of inaccuracies of the energy functions used in modeling and design, and because protein active and binding sites are highly sensitive to subtle changes in structure. Here we describe a new method that addresses the second problem and couples changes in the structure of the protein backbone and of the amino acid side chains, the amino acid sequence, and the conformation of the ligand and its orientation in the binding site. We show that our method improvements significantly increase the accuracy of designing protein–ligand interactions compared to current state-of-the-art design methods. We assess these improvements in two important tests: the first predicts mutations that change ligand-binding preferences in enzymes, and the second predicts protein sequences that bind a given ligand. In these tests, subtle conformational changes made in our model are essential to recapitulate both the results from engineering experiments and the sequence diversity occurring in natural protein families. These results therefore shed light on the mechanisms of how new protein functions might have emerged and can be engineered in the laboratory.},

	abstract = {Conformer generation has important implications in cheminformatics, particularly in computational drug discovery where the quality of conformer generation software may affect the outcome of a virtual screening exercise. We examine the performance of four freely available small molecule conformer generation tools (Balloon, Confab, Frog2, and {RDKit}) alongside a commercial tool ({MOE}). The aim of this study is 3-fold: (i) to identify which tools most accurately reproduce experimentally determined structures; (ii) to examine the diversity of the generated conformational set; and (iii) to benchmark the computational time expended. These aspects were tested using a set of 708 drug-like molecules assembled from the {OMEGA} validation set and the Astex Diverse Set. These molecules have varying physicochemical properties and at least one known X-ray crystal structure. We found that {RDKit} and Confab are statistically better than other methods at generating low rmsd conformers to the known structure. {RDKit} is particularly suited for less flexible molecules while Confab, with its systematic approach, is able to generate conformers which are geometrically closer to the experimentally determined structure for molecules with a large number of rotatable bonds (?10). In our tests {RDKit} also resulted as the second fastest method after Frog2. In order to enhance the performance of {RDKit}, we developed a postprocessing algorithm to build a diverse and representative set of conformers which also contains a close conformer to the known structure. Our analysis indicates that, with postprocessing, {RDKit} is a valid free alternative to commercial, proprietary software.},

	abstract = {Protein dynamics are essential for protein function, and yet it has been challenging to access the underlying atomic motions in solution on nanosecond-to-microsecond time scales. We present a structural ensemble of ubiquitin, refined against residual dipolar couplings ({RDCs}), comprising solution dynamics up to microseconds. The ensemble covers the complete structural heterogeneity observed in 46 ubiquitin crystal structures, most of which are complexes with other proteins. Conformational selection, rather than induced-fit motion, thus suffices to explain the molecular recognition dynamics of ubiquitin. Marked correlations are seen between the flexibility of the ensemble and contacts formed in ubiquitin complexes. A large part of the solution dynamics is concentrated in one concerted mode, which accounts for most of ubiquitin's molecular recognition heterogeneity and ensures a low entropic complex formation cost.
In solution, ubiquitin assumes all conformations seen in crystal structures of its complexes, indicating that it binds by conformational selection rather than induced fit.

As a result, the simulation engine solves the ballistic equations of motion for only those particles participating in a collision, instead of solving Newton's equations of motion for every particle in the system. Because fewer calculations are performed per time step, the {DMD} technique allows for longer time and length scales to become accessible in the simulation of large biomolecules. The use of coarse-grained models extends the computational advantage of this method. Although some accuracy is sacrificed to speed, because of the usefulness of {DMD} to the simulation of many particles at longer timescales, the technique has seen application to diverse molecular systems. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. {WIREs} Comput Mol Sci 2011 1 80–92 {DOI}: 10.1002/wcms.4},

Mutations in the  {SOD}1 ,  {TARDBP} , and  {FUS}  genes have been commonly identified in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ({ALS}). However, possible interactions between these {ALS}–causative genetic mutations have not been examined. Here we expressed each of three human  {FUS}  mutations (R521H, R521C, and S57?) in zebrafish embryos, with or without knocking down the zebrafish homolog  Fus , and observed a motor phenotype consisting of significant behavioral (touch-evoked escape response) and cellular (shortened axonal projections from motor neurons) deficits due to loss of function for the R521H and R521C mutations and/or toxic gain of function solely for the R521H mutation. Wild-type  {FUS}  could rescue the  Tardbp  knockdown phenotype, but not  vice versa , suggesting that  {TARDBP}  is upstream of  {FUS}  in this pathway responsible for motor neuron disorder. Furthermore, neither  {TARDBP}  nor  {FUS}  were able to modify and/or rescue the motor phenotype caused by mutant  {SOD}1 , and likewise  {SOD}1  failed to rescue the phenotype of zebrafish expressing mutant  {TARDBP}  or  {FUS} . Our results indicate that  {TARDBP}  acts upstream of  {FUS}  in a pathogenic pathway that is distinct from that of  {SOD}1 .},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that causes selective death of motor neurons followed by paralysis and death. A subset of {ALS} cases is caused by mutations in the gene for Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase ({SOD}1), which impart a toxic gain of function to this antioxidant enzyme. This neurotoxic property is widely believed to stem from an increased propensity to misfold and aggregate caused by decreased stability of the native homodimer or a tendency to lose stabilizing posttranslational modifications. Study of the molecular mechanisms of {SOD}1-related {ALS} has revealed a complex array of interconnected pathological processes, including glutamate excitotoxicity, dysregulation of neurotrophic factors and axon guidance proteins, axonal transport defects, mitochondrial dysfunction, deficient protein quality control, and aberrant {RNA} processing. Many of these pathologies are directly exacerbated by misfolded and aggregated {SOD}1 and/or cytosolic calcium overload, suggesting the primacy of these events in disease etiology and their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.},

This is because we long have had to infer how proteins function from the static snapshots of their structures and dynamic behavior of optical makers attached to the molecules. This limitation has recently been removed to a large extent by the materialization of high-speed atomic force microscopy ({HS}-{AFM}). {HS}-{AFM} allows us to directly visualize the structure dynamics and dynamic processes of biological molecules in physiological solutions, at subsecond to sub-100-ms temporal resolution, without disturbing their function. In fact, dynamically acting molecules such as myosin V walking on an actin filament and bacteriorhodopsin in response to light are successfully visualized. In this review, we first describe theoretical considerations for the highest possible imaging rate of this new microscope, and then highlight recent imaging studies. Finally, the current limitation and future challenges to explore are described.},

	abstract = {Since the linking of mutations in the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase gene (sod1) to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) in 1993, researchers have sought the connection between {SOD}1 and motor neuron death. Disease-linked mutations tend to destabilize the native dimeric structure of {SOD}1, and plaques containing misfolded and aggregated {SOD}1 have been found in the motor neurons of patients with {ALS}. Despite advances in understanding of {ALS} disease progression and {SOD}1 folding and stability, cytotoxic species and mechanisms remain unknown, greatly impeding the search for and design of therapeutic interventions. Here, we definitively link cytotoxicity associated with {SOD}1 aggregation in {ALS} to a nonnative trimeric {SOD}1 species. We develop methodology for the incorporation of low-resolution experimental data into simulations toward the structural modeling of metastable, multidomain aggregation intermediates. We apply this methodology to derive the structure of a {SOD}1 trimer, which we validate in vitro and in hybridized motor neurons. We show that {SOD}1 mutants designed to promote trimerization increase cell death. Further, we demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of the designed mutants correlates with trimer stability, providing a direct link between the presence of misfolded oligomers and neuron death. Identification of cytotoxic species is the first and critical step in elucidating the molecular etiology of {ALS}, and the ability to manipulate formation of these species will provide an avenue for the development of future therapeutic strategies.},

In certain disciplines, there exist established benchmarks and public resources where experts in a particular methodology are encouraged to supply their most efficient implementation of each particular benchmark. We aim to provide such a resource for protocols in macromolecular modeling and design. We present a freely accessible web resource ( https://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/benchmarks ) to guide the development of protocols for protein modeling and design. The site provides benchmark datasets and metrics to compare the performance of a variety of modeling protocols using different computational sampling methods and energy functions, providing a “best practice” set of parameters for each method. Each benchmark has an associated downloadable benchmark capture archive containing the input files, analysis scripts, and tutorials for running the benchmark. The captures may be run with any suitable modeling method; we supply command lines for running the benchmarks using the Rosetta software suite. We have compiled initial benchmarks for the resource spanning three key areas: prediction of energetic effects of mutations, protein design, and protein structure prediction, each with associated state-of-the-art modeling protocols. With the help of the wider macromolecular modeling community, we hope to expand the variety of benchmarks included on the website and continue to evaluate new iterations of current methods as they become available.},

These rules relate the base specified by a single {TALE} repeat to the identity of two key residues (the repeat variable diresidue, or {RVD}) and enable design for new sequence targets via modular shuffling of these units. A key limitation of these rules is that their simplicity precludes options for improving designs that are insufficiently active or specific. Here we address this limitation by developing an expanded set of {RVDs} and applying them to improve the performance of previously described {TALEs}. As an extreme example, total conversion of a {TALE} nuclease to new {RVDs} substantially reduced off-target cleavage in cellular studies. By providing new {RVDs} and design strategies, these studies establish options for developing improved {TALEs} for broader application across medicine and biotechnology.},

The Ras family of enzymes mediate signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and development by cycling between active and inactive conformational states. Mutations that affect the ability to switch between states are associated with a variety of cancers. However, details of how the structural changes occur and how mutations affect the fidelity of this process remain to be determined. Here we employ an advanced computational technique, termed accelerated molecular dynamics, to characterize structural transitions and identify novel highly populated transient conformations. Several spatially distant structural regions were found to undergo correlated motions, highlighting a dynamic linkage between the sites of enzymatic reaction and the membrane-interacting C-terminus. In addition, our results indicate that the major motion occurring during the conformational exchange is a low-frequency motion intrinsic to the structure. Hence, features of the characterized transitions likely apply to a large number of structurally similar but functionally diverse nucleotide triphosphatases. These results provide fresh insights into how oncogenic mutations might modulate conformational transitions in Ras.},

Over this period there has been a continuing interest in pushing the boundaries of this approach in terms of the size of the systems and the timescale of the processes that can be studied. Coarse-grained models offer in principle great opportunities in this context, but it has been extremely challenging to obtain force fields of accuracy comparable to that typical of fully atomistic models. We show here that the representation of protein molecules as self-avoiding tubes within the {CamTube} model enables the comprehensive, accurate and very fast exploration of the conformational space of proteins in molecular dynamics simulations. We illustrate in particular how the comprehensive mapping of the protein fold universe obtained using the {CamTube} model offers the possibility of analysing the behaviour of proteins in a wide range of non-native states.},

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that protein dynamics and conformational changes can play an important role in modulating biological function. As a result, experimental and computational methods are being developed, often synergistically, to study the dynamical heterogeneity of a protein or other macromolecules in solution. Thus, methods such as molecular dynamics simulations or ensemble refinement approaches have provided conformational ensembles that can be used to understand protein function and biophysics. These developments have in turn created a need for algorithms and software that can be used to compare structural ensembles in the same way as the root-mean-square-deviation is often used to compare static structures. Although a few such approaches have been proposed, these can be difficult to implement efficiently, hindering a broader applications and further developments. Here, we present an easily accessible software toolkit, called {ENCORE}, which can be used to compare conformational ensembles generated either from simulations alone or synergistically with experiments. {ENCORE} implements three previously described methods for ensemble comparison, that each can be used to quantify the similarity between conformational ensembles by estimating the overlap between the probability distributions that underlie them. We demonstrate the kinds of insights that can be obtained by providing examples of three typical use-cases: comparing ensembles generated with different molecular force fields, assessing convergence in molecular simulations, and calculating differences and similarities in structural ensembles refined with various sources of experimental data. We also demonstrate efficient computational scaling for typical analyses, and robustness against both the size and sampling of the ensembles. {ENCORE} is freely available and extendable, integrates with the established {MDAnalysis} software package, reads ensemble data in many common formats, and can work with large trajectory files.},

Its biological activity involves switching between two distinct states, and several oncogenic mutations affect this switching. Despite significant investigation in silico via methods based on Molecular Dynamics, details are missing on how mutations affect the ability of Ras to access the states it needs to perform its biological activity. In this paper we present an algorithm that is capable of providing such details by exploring the breadth of the structure space of a given protein. The algorithm leverages information gathered in the wet laboratory on long-lived structures of the healthy/wildtype and mutated versions of a protein to effectively explore its structure space and reconstruct the underlying energy landscape. We apply this algorithm to the wildtype H-Ras and two known oncogenic variants, G12V and Q61L. Comparison of the energy landscapes elucidates the detailed mechanism by which the oncogenic mutations affect biological activity. We provide the algorithm for the research community to allow further investigation of the open question on how mutations to the sequence of a protein affect biological activity.},

While most trans-acting {ncRNAs} possess well-defined mechanisms that can regulate transcription or translation, they generally lack the ability to directly sense cellular signals. In this work, we describe a set of design principles for fusing {ncRNAs} to {RNA} aptamers to engineer allosteric {RNA} fusion molecules that modulate the activity of {ncRNAs} in a ligand-inducible way in Escherichia coli. We apply these principles to {ncRNA} regulators that can regulate translation ({IS}10 {ncRNA}) and transcription ({pT}181 {ncRNA}), and demonstrate that our design strategy exhibits high modularity between the aptamer ligand-sensing motif and the {ncRNA} target-recognition motif, which allows us to reconfigure these two motifs to engineer orthogonally acting fusion molecules that respond to different ligands and regulate different targets in the same cell. Finally, we show that the same {ncRNA} fused with different sensing domains results in a sensory-level {NOR} gate that integrates multiple input signals to perform genetic logic. These ligand-sensing {ncRNA} regulators provide useful tools to modulate the activity of structurally related families of {ncRNAs}, and building upon the growing body of {RNA} synthetic biology, our ability to design aptamer–{ncRNA} fusion molecules offers new ways to engineer ligand-sensing regulatory circuits.},

Targeted gene regulation on a genome-wide scale is a powerful strategy for interrogating, perturbing, and engineering cellular systems. Here, we develop a method for controlling gene expression based on Cas9, an {RNA}-guided {DNA} endonuclease from a type {II} {CRISPR} system. We show that a catalytically dead Cas9 lacking endonuclease activity, when coexpressed with a guide {RNA}, generates a {DNA} recognition complex that can specifically interfere with transcriptional elongation, {RNA} polymerase binding, or transcription factor binding. This system, which we call {CRISPR} interference ({CRISPRi}), can efficiently repress expression of targeted genes in Escherichia coli, with no detectable off-target effects. {CRISPRi} can be used to repress multiple target genes simultaneously, and its effects are reversible. We also show evidence that the system can be adapted for gene repression in mammalian cells. This {RNA}-guided {DNA} recognition platform provides a simple approach for selectively perturbing gene expression on a genome-wide scale.},

	abstract = {The accurate design of new protein–protein interactions is a longstanding goal of computational protein design. However, most computationally designed interfaces fail to form experimentally. This investigation compares five previously described successful de novo interface designs with 158 failures. Both sets of proteins were designed with the molecular modeling program Rosetta. Designs were considered a success if a high-resolution crystal structure of the complex closely matched the design model and the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding was less than 10 ?M. The successes and failures represent a wide variety of interface types and design goals including heterodimers, homodimers, peptide-protein interactions, one-sided designs (i.e., where only one of the proteins was mutated) and two-sided designs. The most striking feature of the successful designs is that they have fewer polar atoms at their interfaces than many of the failed designs. Designs that attempted to create extensive sets of interface-spanning hydrogen bonds resulted in no detectable binding. In contrast, polar atoms make up more than 40\% of the interface area of many natural dimers, and native interfaces often contain extensive hydrogen bonding networks. These results suggest that Rosetta may not be accurately balancing hydrogen bonding and electrostatic energies against desolvation penalties and that design processes may not include sufficient sampling to identify side chains in preordered conformations that can fully satisfy the hydrogen bonding potential of the interface.},

A missense mutation that alters the protein binding affinity may cause significant perturbations or complete abolishment of the function, potentially leading to diseases. The availability of computational methods to evaluate the impact of mutations on protein?protein binding is critical for a wide range of biomedical applications. Here, we report an efficient computational approach for predicting the effect of single and multiple missense mutations on protein?protein binding affinity. It is based on a well-tested simulation protocol for structure minimization, modified {MM}-{PBSA} and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousands of mutations. Our simulation protocol yields very good agreement between predicted and experimental values with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.69 and 0.63 and root-mean-square errors of 1.20 and 1.90 kcal mol?1 for single and multiple mutations, respectively. Compared with other available methods, our approach achieves high speed and prediction accuracy and can be applied to large datasets generated by modern genomics initiatives. In addition, we report a crucial role of water model and the polar solvation energy in estimating the changes in binding affinity. Our analysis also reveals that prediction accuracy and effect of mutations on binding strongly depends on the type of mutation and its location in a protein complex.},

	abstract = {{ConspectusBecause} living organisms are in constant motion, the word ?dynamics? can hold many meanings to biologists. Here we focus specifically on the conformational changes that occur in proteins and how studying these protein dynamics may provide insights into enzymatic catalysis.Advances in integrating techniques such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron cryomicroscopy (cryo {EM}) allow us to model the dominant structures and exchange rates for many proteins and protein complexes. For proteins amenable to atomic resolution techniques, the major questions shift from simply describing the motions to discovering their role in function. Concurrently, there is an increasing need for using perturbations to test predictive models of dynamics?function relationships. Examples are the catalytic cycles of dihydrofolate reductase ({DHFR}) and cyclophilin A ({CypA}).In {DHFR}, mutations that alter the ability of the active site to sample productive higher energy states on the millisecond time scale reduce the rate of hydride transfer significantly. Recently identified rescue mutations restore function, but the mechanism by which they do so remains unclear. The exact role of any changes in the dynamics remains an open question. For {CypA}, a network of side chains that exchange between two conformations is critical for catalysis. Mutations that lock the network in one state also reduce catalytic activity.A further understanding of enzyme dynamics of well-studied enzymes such as dihydrofolate reductase and cyclophilin A will lead to improvement in ability to modulate the functions of computationally designed enzymes and large macromolecular machines. In designed enzymes, directed evolution experiments increase catalytic rates. Detailed X-ray studies suggest that these mutations likely limit the conformational space explored by residues in the active site. For proteins where atomic resolution information is currently inaccessible, other techniques such as cryo-{EM} and high-resolution single molecule microscopy continue to advance. Understanding the conformational dynamics of larger systems such as protein machines will likely become more accessible and provide new opportunities to rationally modulate protein function.},

Experimental expression, purification, and affinity determination of protein complexes is an expensive and time-consuming means of evaluating the effect of mutations, making a fast and accurate in silico method highly desirable. When the structure of the wild-type complex is known, it is possible to economically evaluate the effect of point mutations with knowledge based potentials, which do not model backbone flexibility, but these have been validated only for single mutants. Substitution mutations tend to induce local conformational rearrangements only. Accordingly, {ZEMu} (Zone Equilibration of Mutants) flexibilizes only a small region around the site of mutation, then computes its dynamics under a physics-based force field. We validate with 1254 experimental mutants (with 1–15 simultaneous substitutions) in a wide variety of different protein environments (65 protein complexes), and obtain a significant improvement in the accuracy of predicted ??G.

We find that such a flexible backbone design method better recapitulates protein family sequence variation than sequence optimization on fixed backbones or randomly perturbed backbone ensembles for ten diverse protein structures. For the {SH}3 domain, the backbone structure variation in the family is also better recapitulated than in randomly perturbed backbones. The potential application of this method as a model of protein family evolution is highlighted by a concerted transition to the amino acid sequence in the structural core of one {SH}3 domain starting from the backbone coordinates of an homologous structure.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryThe} goal of computational protein design is to create new protein sequences of desirable structure and biological function. Most protein design methods are developed to search for sequences with the lowest free-energy based on physics-based force fields following Anfinsen's thermodynamic hypothesis. A major obstacle of such approaches is the inaccuracy of the force-field design, which cannot accurately describe atomic interactions or correctly recognize protein folds. We propose a novel method which uses evolutionary information, in the form of sequence profiles from structure families, to guide the sequence design. Since sequence profiles are generally more accurate than physics-based potentials in protein fold recognition, a unique advantage lies on that it targets the design procedure to a family of protein sequence profiles to enhance the robustness of designed sequences. The method was tested on 87 proteins and the designed sequences can be folded by I-{TASSER} to models with an average {RMSD} 2.1 Å. As a case study of large-scale application, the method is extended to redesign all structurally resolved proteins in the human pathogenic bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Five sequences varying in fold and sizes were characterized by circular dichroism and {NMR} spectroscopy experiments and three were shown to have ordered tertiary structure.},

To examine the accuracy of mutant structure predictions underlying these computational methods, crystal structures of thermostable limonene epoxide hydrolase variants obtained by computational library design were determined. Four different predicted effects indeed contributed to the obtained stabilization: (i) enhanced interactions between a flexible loop close to the N-terminus and the rest of the protein; (ii) improved interactions at the dimer interface; (iii) removal of unsatisfied hydrogen bonding groups; and (iv) introduction of additional positively charged groups at the surface. The structures of an eightfold and an elevenfold mutant showed that most mutations introduced the intended stabilizing interactions, and side-chain conformations were correctly predicted for 72–88\% of the point mutations. However, mutations that introduced a disulfide bond in a flexible region had a larger influence on the backbone conformation than predicted. The enzyme active sites were unaltered, in agreement with the observed preservation of catalytic activities. The structures also revealed how a c-Myc tag, which was introduced for facile detection and purification, can reduce access to the active site and thereby lower the catalytic activity. Finally, sequence analysis showed that comprehensive mutant energy calculations discovered stabilizing mutations that are not proposed by the consensus or B-{FIT} methods.

By studying the relaxation of the correlation function between consecutive mutations at a given position in proteins, we observe separation of the evolutionary time-scales: at short time intervals families of proteins with similar sequences and structures are formed, while at long time intervals the families of structurally similar proteins that have low sequence similarity are formed.

This paper compares strategies for computing these energies on the fly and caching computed energy values that are likely to be reused. By avoiding the expense of computing pair energies that are not examined by simulated annealing, we show that some caching strategies not only improve running time in design, but also use 90\% less memory, which allows design computations to be performed on memory-limited machines.},

Benchmark 4.0 adds 52 new complexes to the 124 cases of Benchmark 3.0, representing an increase of 42\%.

	abstract = {We consider the problem of loop closure, i.e., of finding the ensemble of possible backbone structures of a chain segment of a protein molecule that is geometrically consistent with preceding and following parts of the chain whose structures are given. We reduce this problem of determining the loop conformations of six torsions to finding the real roots of a 16th degree polynomial in one variable, based on the robotics literature on the kinematics of the equivalent rotator linkage in the most general case of oblique rotators. We provide a simple intuitive view and derivation of the polynomial for the case in which each of the three pair of torsional axes has a common point. Our method generalizes previous work on analytical loop closure in that the torsion angles need not be consecutive, and any rigid intervening segments are allowed between the free torsions. Our approach also allows for a small degree of flexibility in the bond angles and the peptide torsion angles; this substantially enlarges the space of solvable configurations as is demonstrated by an application of the method to the modeling of cyclic pentapeptides. We give further applications to two important problems. First, we show that this analytical loop closure algorithm can be efficiently combined with an existing loop-construction algorithm to sample loops longer than three residues. Second, we show that Monte Carlo minimization is made severalfold more efficient by employing the local moves generated by the loop closure algorithm, when applied to the global minimization of an eight-residue loop.

We have developed a dipeptide segment sampling algorithm to solve this problem. As a first step in evaluating the performance of this algorithm, it was applied to the problem of reconstructing loops in native protein structures. With a newly constructed test set of 89 loops ranging from 14 to 17 residues, this method obtains average/median global backbone root-mean-square deviations ({RMSDs}) to the native structure (superimposing the body of the protein, not the loop itself) of 1.46/0.68 Å. Specifically, results for loops of various lengths are 1.19/0.67 Å for 36 fourteen-residue loops, 1.55/0.75 Å for 30 fifteen-residue loops, 1.43/0.80 Å for 14 sixteen-residue loops, and 2.30/1.92 Å for nine seventeen-residue loops. In the vast majority of cases, the method locates energy minima that are lower than or equal to that of the minimized native loop, thus indicating that the new sampling method is successful and rarely limits prediction accuracy. Median {RMSDs} are substantially lower than the averages because of a small number of outliers. The causes of these failures are examined in some detail, and some can be attributed to flaws in the energy function, such as ?–? interactions are not accurately accounted for by the {OPLS}-{AA} force field we employed in this study. By introducing a new energy model which has a superior description of ?–? interactions, significantly better results were achieved for quite a few former outliers.

Rotamer libraries are used in protein structure determination, prediction, and design. The backbone-dependent rotamer library consists of rotamer frequencies, mean dihedral angles, and variances as a function of the backbone dihedral angles. Structure prediction and design methods that employ backbone flexibility would strongly benefit from smoothly varying probabilities and angles. A new version of the backbone-dependent rotamer library has been developed using adaptive kernel density estimates for the rotamer frequencies and adaptive kernel regression for the mean dihedral angles and variances. This formulation allows for evaluation of the rotamer probabilities, mean angles, and variances as a smooth and continuous function of phi and psi. Continuous probability density estimates for the nonrotameric degrees of freedom of amides, carboxylates, and aromatic side chains have been modeled as a function of the backbone dihedrals and rotamers of the remaining degrees of freedom. New backbone-dependent rotamer libraries at varying levels of smoothing are available from http://dunbrack.fccc.edu.},

	abstract = {The application of all-atom force fields (and explicit or implicit solvent models) to protein homology-modeling tasks such as side-chain and loop prediction remains challenging both because of the expense of the individual energy calculations and because of the difficulty of sampling the rugged all-atom energy surface. Here we address this challenge for the problem of loop prediction through the development of numerous new algorithms, with an emphasis on multiscale and hierarchical techniques. As a first step in evaluating the performance of our loop prediction algorithm, we have applied it to the problem of reconstructing loops in native structures; we also explicitly include crystal packing to provide a fair comparison with crystal structures. In brief, large numbers of loops are generated by using a dihedral angle-based buildup procedure followed by iterative cycles of clustering, side-chain optimization, and complete energy minimization of selected loop structures. We evaluate this method by using the largest test set yet used for validation of a loop prediction method, with a total of 833 loops ranging from 4 to 12 residues in length. Average/median backbone root-mean-square deviations ({RMSDs}) to the native structures (superimposing the body of the protein, not the loop itself) are 0.42/0.24 Å for 5 residue loops, 1.00/0.44 Å for 8 residue loops, and 2.47/1.83 Å for 11 residue loops. Median {RMSDs} are substantially lower than the averages because of a small number of outliers; the causes of these failures are examined in some detail, and many can be attributed to errors in assignment of protonation states of titratable residues, omission of ligands from the simulation, and, in a few cases, probable errors in the experimentally determined structures. When these obvious problems in the data sets are filtered out, average {RMSDs} to the native structures improve to 0.43 Å for 5 residue loops, 0.84 Å for 8 residue loops, and 1.63 Å for 11 residue loops. In the vast majority of cases, the method locates energy minima that are lower than or equal to that of the minimized native loop, thus indicating that sampling rarely limits prediction accuracy. The overall results are, to our knowledge, the best reported to date, and we attribute this success to the combination of an accurate all-atom energy function, efficient methods for loop buildup and side-chain optimization, and, especially for the longer loops, the hierarchical refinement protocol.

	abstract = {A major limitation of current comparative modeling methods is the accuracy with which regions that are structurally divergent from homologues of known structure can be modeled. Because structural differences between homologous proteins are responsible for variations in protein function and specificity, the ability to model these differences has important functional consequences. Although existing methods can provide reasonably accurate models of short loop regions, modeling longer structurally divergent regions is an unsolved problem. Here we describe a method based on the de novo structure prediction algorithm, Rosetta, for predicting conformations of structurally divergent regions in comparative models. Initial conformations for short segments are selected from the protein structure database, whereas longer segments are built up by using three- and nine-residue fragments drawn from the database and combined by using the Rosetta algorithm. A gap closure term in the potential in combination with modified Newton's method for gradient descent minimization is used to ensure continuity of the peptide backbone. Conformations of variable regions are refined in the context of a fixed template structure using Monte Carlo minimization together with rapid repacking of side-chains to iteratively optimize backbone torsion angles and side-chain rotamers. For short loops, mean accuracies of 0.69, 1.45, and 3.62 Å are obtained for 4, 8, and 12 residue loops, respectively. In addition, the method can provide reasonable models of conformations of longer protein segments: predicted conformations of 3Å root-mean-square deviation or better were obtained for 5 of 10 examples of segments ranging from 13 to 34 residues. In combination with a sequence alignment algorithm, this method generates complete, ungapped models of protein structures, including regions both similar to and divergent from a homologous structure. This combined method was used to make predictions for 28 protein domains in the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure 4 ({CASP} 4) and 59 domains in {CASP} 5, where the method ranked highly among comparative modeling and fold recognition methods. Model accuracy in these blind predictions is dominated by alignment quality, but in the context of accurate alignments, long protein segments can be accurately modeled. Notably, the method correctly predicted the local structure of a 39-residue insertion into a {TIM} barrel in {CASP} 5 target T0186. Proteins 2004. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Comparative protein structure prediction is limited mostly by the errors in alignment and loop modeling. We describe here a new automated modeling technique that significantly improves the accuracy of loop predictions in protein structures. The positions of all nonhydrogen atoms of the loop are optimized in a fixed environment with respect to a pseudo energy function. The energy is a sum of many spatial restraints that include the bond length, bond angle, and improper dihedral angle terms from the {CHARMM}-22 force field, statistical preferences for the main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles, and statistical preferences for nonbonded atomic contacts that depend on the two atom types, their distance through space, and separation in sequence. The energy function is optimized with the method of conjugate gradients combined with molecular dynamics and simulated annealing. Typically, the predicted loop conformation corresponds to the lowest energy conformation among 500 independent optimizations. Predictions were made for 40 loops of known structure at each length from 1 to 14 residues. The accuracy of loop predictions is evaluated as a function of thoroughness of conformational sampling, loop length, and structural properties of native loops. When accuracy is measured by local superposition of the model on the native loop, 100, 90, and 30\% of 4–, 8–, and 12–residue loop predictions, respectively, had {\textless}2 Å {RMSD} error for the mainchain N, Ca, C, and O atoms; the average accuracies were 0.59 6 0.05, 1.16 6 0.10, and 2.61 6 0.16 Å, respectively. To simulate real comparative modeling problems, the method was also evaluated by predicting loops of known structure in only approximately correct environments with errors typical of comparative modeling without misalignment. When the {RMSD} distortion of the main-chain stem atoms is 2.5 Å, the average loop prediction error increased by 180, 25, and 3\% for 4–, 8–, and 12–residue loops, respectively. The accuracy of the lowest energy prediction for a given loop can be estimated from the structural variability among a number of low energy predictions. The relative value of the present method is gauged by (1) comparing it with one of the most successful previously described methods, and (2) describing its accuracy in recent blind predictions of protein structure. Finally, it is shown that the average accuracy of prediction is limited primarily by the accuracy of the energy function rather than by the extent of conformational sampling.},

	abstract = {Achieving atomic-level accuracy in comparative protein models is limited by our ability to refine the initial, homolog-derived model closer to the native state. Despite considerable effort, progress in developing a generalized refinement method has been limited. In contrast, methods have been described that can accurately reconstruct loop conformations in native protein structures. We hypothesize that loop refinement in homology models is much more difficult than loop reconstruction in crystal structures, in part, because side-chain, backbone, and other structural inaccuracies surrounding the loop create a challenging sampling problem; the loop cannot be refined without simultaneously refining adjacent portions. In this work, we single out one sampling issue in an artificial but useful test set and examine how loop refinement accuracy is affected by errors in surrounding side-chains. In 80 high-resolution crystal structures, we first perturbed 6–12 residue loops away from the crystal conformation, and placed all protein side chains in non-native but low energy conformations. Even these relatively small perturbations in the surroundings made the loop prediction problem much more challenging. Using a previously published loop prediction method, median backbone (N-C?-C-O) {RMSD}'s for groups of 6, 8, 10, and 12 residue loops are 0.3/0.6/0.4/0.6 Å, respectively, on native structures and increase to 1.1/2.2/1.5/2.3 Å on the perturbed cases. We then augmented our previous loop prediction method to simultaneously optimize the rotamer states of side chains surrounding the loop. Our results show that this augmented loop prediction method can recover the native state in many perturbed structures where the previous method failed; the median {RMSD}'s for the 6, 8, 10, and 12 residue perturbed loops improve to 0.4/0.8/1.1/1.2 Å. Finally, we highlight three comparative models from blind tests, in which our new method predicted loops closer to the native conformation than first modeled using the homolog template, a task generally understood to be difficult. Although many challenges remain in refining full comparative models to high accuracy, this work offers a methodical step toward that goal. Proteins 2008. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {To accurately predict protein conformations in atomic detail, a computational method must be capable of sampling models sufficiently close to the native structure. All-atom sampling is difficult because of the vast number of possible conformations and extremely rugged energy landscapes. Here, we test three sampling strategies to address these difficulties: conformational diversification, intensification of torsion and omega-angle sampling and parameter annealing. We evaluate these strategies in the context of the robotics-based kinematic closure ({KIC}) method for local conformational sampling in Rosetta on an established benchmark set of 45 12-residue protein segments without regular secondary structure. We quantify performance as the fraction of sub-Angstrom models generated. While improvements with individual strategies are only modest, the combination of intensification and annealing strategies into a new “next-generation {KIC}” method yields a four-fold increase over standard {KIC} in the median percentage of sub-Angstrom models across the dataset. Such improvements enable progress on more difficult problems, as demonstrated on longer segments, several of which could not be accurately remodeled with previous methods. Given its improved sampling capability, next-generation {KIC} should allow advances in other applications such as local conformational remodeling of multiple segments simultaneously, flexible backbone sequence design, and development of more accurate energy functions.},

	abstract = {Predicting the set of sequences that are tolerated by a protein or protein interface, while maintaining a desired function, is useful for characterizing protein interaction specificity and for computationally designing sequence libraries to engineer proteins with new functions. Here we provide a general method, a detailed set of protocols, and several benchmarks and analyses for estimating tolerated sequences using flexible backbone protein design implemented in the Rosetta molecular modeling software suite. The input to the method is at least one experimentally determined three-dimensional protein structure or high-quality model. The starting structure(s) are expanded or refined into a conformational ensemble using Monte Carlo simulations consisting of backrub backbone and side chain moves in Rosetta. The method then uses a combination of simulated annealing and genetic algorithm optimization methods to enrich for low-energy sequences for the individual members of the ensemble. To emphasize certain functional requirements (e.g. forming a binding interface), interactions between and within parts of the structure (e.g. domains) can be reweighted in the scoring function. Results from each backbone structure are merged together to create a single estimate for the tolerated sequence space. We provide an extensive description of the protocol and its parameters, all source code, example analysis scripts and three tests applying this method to finding sequences predicted to stabilize proteins or protein interfaces. The generality of this method makes many other applications possible, for example stabilizing interactions with small molecules, {DNA}, or {RNA}. Through the use of within-domain reweighting and/or multistate design, it may also be possible to use this method to find sequences that stabilize particular protein conformations or binding interactions over others.},

Multicellular organisms rely on complex, fine-tuned protein networks to respond to environmental changes. We used in vitro evolution to explore the role of domain mutation and expansion in the evolution of network complexity. Using random mutagenesis to facilitate family expansion, we asked how versatile and robust the binding site must be to produce the rich functional diversity of the natural {PDZ} domain family. From a combinatorial protein library, we analyzed several hundred structured domain variants and found that one-quarter were functional for carboxyl-terminal ligand recognition and that our variant repertoire was as specific and diverse as the natural family. Our results show that ligand binding is hardwired in the {PDZ} fold and suggest that this flexibility may facilitate the rapid evolution of complex protein interaction networks.},

Results: We have developed a rapid, simple and general method based on information theory that accurately estimates the level of background mutual information for each pair of positions in a given protein family. Removal of this background results in a metric, {MIp}, that correctly identifies substantially more coevolving positions in protein families than any existing method. A significant fraction of these positions coevolve strongly with one or only a few positions. The vast majority of such position pairs are in contact in representative structures. The identification of strongly coevolving position pairs can be used to impose significant structural limitations and should be an important additional constraint for ab initio protein folding.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0011082},
	abstract = {Background
There is currently no way to verify the quality of a multiple sequence alignment that is independent of the assumptions used to build it. Sequence alignments are typically evaluated by a number of established criteria: sequence conservation, the number of aligned residues, the frequency of gaps, and the probable correct gap placement. Covariation analysis is used to find putatively important residue pairs in a sequence alignment. Different alignments of the same protein family give different results demonstrating that covariation depends on the quality of the sequence alignment. We thus hypothesized that current criteria are insufficient to build alignments for use with covariation analyses.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We show that current criteria are insufficient to build alignments for use with covariation analyses as systematic sequence alignment errors are present even in hand-curated structure-based alignment datasets like those from the Conserved Domain Database. We show that current non-parametric covariation statistics are sensitive to sequence misalignments and that this sensitivity can be used to identify systematic alignment errors. We demonstrate that removing alignment errors due to 1) improper structure alignment, 2) the presence of paralogous sequences, and 3) partial or otherwise erroneous sequences, improves contact prediction by covariation analysis. Finally we describe two non-parametric covariation statistics that are less sensitive to sequence alignment errors than those described previously in the literature.

Conclusions/Significance
Protein alignments with errors lead to false positive and false negative conclusions (incorrect assignment of covariation and conservation, respectively). Covariation analysis can provide a verification step, independent of traditional criteria, to identify systematic misalignments in protein alignments. Two non-parametric statistics are shown to be somewhat insensitive to misalignment errors, providing increased confidence in contact prediction when analyzing alignments with erroneous regions because of an emphasis on they emphasize pairwise covariation over group covariation.},

Remarkably, in the designed sequences 51\% of the core residues and 27\% of all residues were identical to the amino acids in the corresponding positions in the native sequences. The lowest free energy sequences obtained for ensembles of native-like backbone structures were also similar to the native sequence. Furthermore, both the individual residue frequencies and the covariances between pairs of positions observed in the very large {SH}3 domain family were recapitulated in core sequences designed for {SH}3 domain structures.

We illustrate how Rosetta simulations that apply backrub moves improve modeling of point mutant side-chain conformations, native side-chain conformational heterogeneity, functional conformational changes, tolerated sequence space, protein interaction specificity, and amino acid covariation across protein–protein interfaces. We include relevant Rosetta command lines and {RosettaScripts} to encourage the application of these types of simulations to other systems. Our work highlights that critical scoring and sampling improvements will be necessary to approximate conformational landscapes.

Consequently, the sequences of today's naturally occurring proteins contain signatures reflecting the constraints imposed by protein structure. Here we test the ability of computational protein design methods to recapitulate and explain these signatures. We focus on the physical basis of evolutionary pressures that act on interactions between amino acids in folded proteins, which are critical in determining protein structure and function. Such pressures can be observed from the appearance of amino acid covariation, where the amino acids at certain positions in protein sequences are correlated with each other. We find similar patterns of amino acid covariation in natural sequences and sequences optimized for their structures using computational protein design, demonstrating the importance of structural constraints in protein molecular evolution and providing insights into the structural mechanisms leading to covariation. In addition, these results characterize the ability of computational methods to model the precise details of correlated amino acid changes, which is critical for engineering new proteins with useful functions beyond those seen in nature.},

Protein-protein interactions are key components of all signal transduction processes, so methods to alter these interactions promise to become important tools in dissecting function of connectivities in these networks. We have developed a fast computational approach for the prediction of energetically important amino acid residues in protein-protein interfaces (available at http://robetta.bakerlab.org/alaninescan), which we, following Peter Kollman, have termed "computational alanine scanning." The input consists of a three-dimensional structure of a protein-protein complex; output is a list of "hot spots," or amino acid side chains that are predicted to significantly destabilize the interface when mutated to alanine, analogous to the results of experimental alanine-scanning mutagenesis. 79\% of hot spots and 68\% of neutral residues were correctly predicted in a test of 233 mutations in 19 protein-protein complexes. A single interface can be analyzed in minutes. The computational methodology has been validated by the successful design of protein interfaces with new specificity and activity, and has yielded new insights into the mechanisms of receptor specificity and promiscuity in biological systems.},

Based on our previous method ({KFC}), we present two new methods ({KFC}2a and {KFC}2b) that outperform other methods at hot spot prediction. A number of improvements were made in developing these new methods. First, we created a training data set that contained a similar number of hot spot and non-hot spot residues. In addition, we generated 47 different features, and different numbers of features were used to train the models to avoid over-fitting. Finally, two feature combinations were selected: One (used in {KFC}2a) is composed of eight features that are mainly related to solvent accessible surface area and local plasticity; the other ({KFC}2b) is composed of seven features, only two of which are identical to those used in {KFC}2a. The two models were built using support vector machines ({SVM}). The two {KFC}2 models were then tested on a mixed independent test set, and compared with other methods such as Robetta, {FOLDEF}, {HotPoint}, {MINERVA}, and {KFC}. {KFC}2a showed the highest predictive accuracy for hot spot residues (True Positive Rate: {TPR} = 0.85); however, the false positive rate was somewhat higher than for other models. {KFC}2b showed the best predictive accuracy for hot spot residues (True Positive Rate: {TPR} = 0.62) among all methods other than {KFC}2a, and the False Positive Rate ({FPR} = 0.15) was comparable with other highly predictive methods.

In principle, given the structure of a wild-type protein and a point mutation whose effects are to be predicted, an accurate method should recapitulate both the structural changes and the change in the folding-free energy. Here, we explore the performance of protocols which sample an increasing diversity of conformations. We find that surprisingly similar performances in predicting changes in stability are achieved using protocols that involve very different amounts of conformational sampling, provided that the resolution of the force field is matched to the resolution of the sampling method. Methods involving backbone sampling can in some cases closely recapitulate the structural changes accompanying mutations but not surprisingly tend to do more harm than good in cases where structural changes are negligible. Analysis of the outliers in the stability change calculations suggests areas needing particular improvement; these include the balance between desolvation and the formation of favorable buried polar interactions, and unfolded state modeling.

	abstract = {The {KFC} Server is a web-based implementation of the {KFC} (Knowledge-based {FADE} and Contacts) model—a machine learning approach for the prediction of binding hot spots, or the subset of residues that account for most of a protein interface's; binding free energy. The server facilitates the automated analysis of a user submitted protein–protein or protein–{DNA} interface and the visualization of its hot spot predictions. For each residue in the interface, the {KFC} Server characterizes its local structural environment, compares that environment to the environments of experimentally determined hot spots and predicts if the interface residue is a hot spot. After the computational analysis, the user can visualize the results using an interactive job viewer able to quickly highlight predicted hot spots and surrounding structural features within the protein structure. The {KFC} Server is accessible at http://kfc.mitchell-lab.org.},

To analyze the contributions of individual amino acid residues in protein-protein binding we have compiled a database of 2325 alanine mutants for which the change in free energy of binding upon mutation to alanine has been measured (available at http://motorhead.ucsf.edu/?thorn/hotspot). Our analysis shows that at the level of side-chains there is little correlation between buried surface area and free energy of binding. We find that the free energy of binding is not evenly distributed across interfaces; instead, there are hot spots of binding energy made up of a small subset of residues in the dimer interface. These hot spots are enriched in tryptophan, tyrosine and arginine, and are surrounded by energetically less important residues that most likely serve to occlude bulk solvent from the hot spot. Occlusion of solvent is found to be a necessary condition for highly energetic interactions.},

Individual replacement of contact residues in the {hGHbp} with alanine showed that a central hydrophobic region, dominated by two tryptophan residues, accounts for more than three-quarters of the binding free energy. This "functional epitope" is surrounded by less important contact residues that are generally hydrophilic and partially hydrated, so that the interface resembles a cross section through a globular protein. The functionally important residues on the {hGHbp} directly contact those on {hGH}. Thus, only a small and complementary set of contact residues maintains binding affinity, a property that may be general to protein-protein interfaces.},

To simultaneously model these two types of behavior, we refined an orientation dependent model of hydrogen bonds [Kortemme et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2003, 326, 1239] used by the molecular modeling program Rosetta and then combined it with a distance-dependent Coulomb model of electrostatics. The functional form of the H-bond potential is physically motivated and parameters are fit so that H-bond geometries that Rosetta generates closely resemble H-bond geometries in high-resolution crystal structures. The combined potentials improve performance in a variety of scientific benchmarks including decoy discrimination, side chain prediction, and native sequence recovery in protein design simulations and establishes a new standard energy function for Rosetta.},

Many of these functions were also developed to estimate the consequence of mutation on protein stability or binding affinity. In the current study, we chose six different methods that were previously reported as being able to predict the change in protein stability (??G) upon mutation: {CC}/{PBSA}, {EGAD}, {FoldX}, I-Mutant2.0, Rosetta and Hunter. We evaluated their performance on a large set of 2156 single mutations, avoiding for each program the mutations used for training. The correlation coefficients between experimental and predicted ??G values were in the range of 0.59 for the best and 0.26 for the worst performing method. All the tested computational methods showed a correct trend in their predictions, but failed in providing the precise values. This is not due to lack in precision of the experimental data, which showed a correlation coefficient of 0.86 between different measurements. Combining the methods did not significantly improve prediction accuracy compared to a single method. These results suggest that there is still room for improvement, which is crucial if we want forcefields to perform better in their various tasks.},

The different energy terms taken into account in {FOLDEF} have been weighted using empirical data obtained from protein engineering experiments. First, we considered a training database of 339 mutants in nine different proteins and optimised the set of parameters and weighting factors that best accounted for the changes in stability of the mutants. The predictive power of the method was then tested using a blind test mutant database of 667 mutants, as well as a database of 82 protein–protein complex mutants. The global correlation obtained for 95 \% of the entire mutant database (1030 mutants) is 0.83 with a standard deviation of 0.81 kcal mol?1 and a slope of 0.76. The present energy function uses a minimum of computational resources and can therefore easily be used in protein design algorithms, and in the field of protein structure and folding pathways prediction where one requires a fast and accurate energy function. {FOLDEF} is available via a web-interface at http://fold-x.embl-heidelberg.de},

The article describes the conduct of the experiment, the categories of prediction included, and outlines the evaluation and assessment procedures. The 10 {CASP} experiments span almost 20 years of progress in the field of protein structure modeling, and there have been enormous advances in methods and model accuracy in that period. Notable in this round is the first sustained improvement of models with refinement methods, using molecular dynamics. For the first time, we tested the ability of modeling methods to make use of sparse experimental three-dimensional contact information, such as may be obtained from new experimental techniques, with encouraging results. On the other hand, new contact prediction methods, though holding considerable promise, have yet to make an impact in {CASP} testing. The nature of {CASP} targets has been changing in recent {CASPs}, reflecting shifts in experimental structural biology, with more irregular structures, more multi-domain and multi-subunit structures, and less standard versions of known folds. When allowance is made for these factors, we continue to see steady progress in the overall accuracy of models, particularly resulting from improvement of non-template regions.

However, such models require empirical training data and proper validation before they can be widely applied. Previous databases contained few stabilizing mutations and no discussion of their inherent biases or how this impacts model construction or validation.
Results: We present {SKEMPI}, a database of 3047 binding free energy changes upon mutation assembled from the scientific literature, for protein–protein heterodimeric complexes with experimentally determined structures. This represents over four times more data than previously collected. Changes in 713 association and dissociation rates and 127 enthalpies and entropies were also recorded. The existence of biases towards specific mutations, residues, interfaces, proteins and protein families is discussed in the context of how the data can be used to construct predictive models. Finally, a cross-validation scheme is presented which is capable of estimating the efficacy of derived models on future data in which these biases are not present.

	abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is one of the most frequent problems in biology. This task is usually facilitated by accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program {MODELLER} and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis ({TvLDH}) is described as an example. The download and installation of the {MODELLER} software is also described. Curr. Protoc.

The alanine scan revealed a cluster of a dozen large side chains that when mutated to alanine each showed more than a four times lower binding affinity to the {hGH} receptor. Many of these residues that promote binding to the {hGH} receptor are altered in homologs of {hGH} (such as placental lactogens and prolactins) that do not bind tightly to the {hGH} receptor. The overall folding of these mutant proteins was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type {hGH}, as determined by strong cross-reactivities with seven different conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibodies.

	abstract = {Summary
Apolipoprotein E is associated with age-related risk for Alzheimer's disease and plays critical roles in A? homeostasis. We report that {ApoE} plays a role in facilitating the proteolytic clearance of soluble A? from the brain. The endolytic degradation of A? peptides within microglia by neprilysin and related enzymes is dramatically enhanced by {ApoE}. Similarly, A? degradation extracellularly by insulin-degrading enzyme is facilitated by {ApoE}. The capacity of {ApoE} to promote A? degradation is dependent upon the {ApoE} isoform and its lipidation status. The enhanced expression of lipidated {ApoE}, through the activation of liver X receptors, stimulates A? degradation. Indeed, aged Tg2576 mice treated with the {LXR} agonist {GW}3965 exhibited a dramatic reduction in brain A? load. {GW}3965 treatment also reversed contextual memory deficits. These data demonstrate a mechanism through which {ApoE} facilitates the clearance of A? from the brain and suggest that {LXR} agonists may represent a novel therapy for {AD}.},

Oral administration of the {RXR} agonist bexarotene to a mouse model of {AD} resulted in enhanced clearance of soluble A? within hours in an {apoE}-dependent manner. A? plaque area was reduced more than 50\% within just 72 hours.

	abstract = {The amino acid sequence of a protein governs its function. We used bulk competition and focused deep sequencing to investigate the effects of all ubiquitin point mutants on yeast growth rate. Many aspects of ubiquitin function have been carefully studied, which enabled interpretation of our growth analyses in light of a rich structural, biophysical and biochemical knowledge base. In one highly sensitive cluster on the surface of ubiquitin, almost every amino acid substitution caused growth defects. In contrast, the opposite face tolerated virtually all possible substitutions. Surface locations between these two faces exhibited intermediate mutational tolerance. The sensitive face corresponds to the known interface for many binding partners. Across all surface positions, we observe a strong correlation between burial at structurally characterized interfaces and the number of amino acid substitutions compatible with robust growth. This result indicates that binding is a dominant determinant of ubiquitin function. In the solvent-inaccessible core of ubiquitin, all positions tolerated a limited number of substitutions, with hydrophobic amino acids especially interchangeable. Some mutations null for yeast growth were previously shown to populate folded conformations indicating that, for these mutants, subtle changes to conformation caused functional defects. The most sensitive region to mutation within the core was located near the C-terminus that is a focal binding site for many critical binding partners. These results indicate that core mutations may frequently cause functional defects through subtle disturbances to structure or dynamics.},

Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the {AMBER} all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the {RHF}/6-31G*//{RHF}/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. The {CHARMM} program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with {CHARMM} can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original {CHARMM} article in 1983. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.J Comput Chem, 2009.},

We investigate the extent to which a simple physical model can account for the wide range of experimentally measured free energy changes brought about by alanine mutation at protein–protein interfaces. The model successfully predicts the results of alanine scanning experiments on globular proteins (743 mutations) and 19 protein–protein interfaces (233 mutations) with average unsigned errors of 0.81 kcal/mol and 1.06 kcal/mol, respectively. The results test our understanding of the dominant contributions to the free energy of protein–protein interactions, can guide experiments aimed at the design of protein interaction inhibitors, and provide a stepping-stone to important applications such as interface redesign.},

	abstract = {How do proteins fold, and why do they fold in that way? This Perspective integrates earlier and more recent advances over the 50-y history of the protein folding problem, emphasizing unambiguously clear structural information. Experimental results show that, contrary to prior belief, proteins are multistate rather than two-state objects. They are composed of separately cooperative foldon building blocks that can be seen to repeatedly unfold and refold as units even under native conditions. Similarly, foldons are lost as units when proteins are destabilized to produce partially unfolded equilibrium molten globules. In kinetic folding, the inherently cooperative nature of foldons predisposes the thermally driven amino acid-level search to form an initial foldon and subsequent foldons in later assisted searches. The small size of foldon units, ?20 residues, resolves the Levinthal time-scale search problem. These microscopic-level search processes can be identified with the disordered multitrack search envisioned in the “new view” model for protein folding. Emergent macroscopic foldon–foldon interactions then collectively provide the structural guidance and free energy bias for the ordered addition of foldons in a stepwise pathway that sequentially builds the native protein. These conclusions reconcile the seemingly opposed new view and defined pathway models; the two models account for different stages of the protein folding process. Additionally, these observations answer the “how” and the “why” questions. The protein folding pathway depends on the same foldon units and foldon–foldon interactions that construct the native structure.},

	abstract = {A unique feature of chemical catalysis mediated by enzymes is that the catalytically reactive atoms are embedded within a folded protein. Although current understanding of enzyme function has been focused on the chemical reactions and static three-dimensional structures, the dynamic nature of proteins has been proposed to have a function in catalysis. The concept of conformational substates has been described; however, the challenge is to unravel the intimate linkage between protein flexibility and enzymatic function. Here we show that the intrinsic plasticity of the protein is a key characteristic of catalysis. The dynamics of the prolyl cis–trans isomerase cyclophilin A ({CypA}) in its substrate-free state and during catalysis were characterized with {NMR} relaxation experiments. The characteristic enzyme motions detected during catalysis are already present in the free enzyme with frequencies corresponding to the catalytic turnover rates. This correlation suggests that the protein motions necessary for catalysis are an intrinsic property of the enzyme and may even limit the overall turnover rate. Motion is localized not only to the active site but also to a wider dynamic network. Whereas coupled networks in proteins have been proposed previously, we experimentally measured the collective nature of motions with the use of mutant forms of {CypA}. We propose that the pre-existence of collective dynamics in enzymes before catalysis is a common feature of biocatalysts and that proteins have evolved under synergistic pressure between structure and dynamics.},

	abstract = {A human myeloid leukemia cell line, {KBM}-7, was developed from a patient in the blastic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia ({CML}). We characterized its morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and proliferative capacity. Developed in the absence of exogenous lymphokines, {KBM}-7 in vitro cloning capacity actually decreased when colony-stimulating factors were added. The cells had an aberrant immature myeloid phenotype, a doubling time of 22 h in suspension cultures and a high cloning efficiency in semisolid system (24 +/- 3)\%. Early passages contained one near-haploid (predominant) and one hyperdiploid stem line. Gradually the hyperdiploid stem line became predominant, reaching an average of 49 chromosomes per cell. Cells from passage 89 had two Philadelphia chromosomes [t(9;22)(q34;q11)] and lacked normal copies of chromosomes 9 and 22. Detailed molecular characterization of the breakpoint in the t(9;22)(q34;q11) revealed that {KBM}-7 had the {BCR} 2/{ABL} {II} splice junction. The cells had high protein kinase (p210BCR-{ABL}) activity and carried two identified variants of an {ABL}-{BCR} message. There was no evidence that normal {BCR} or c-{ABL} messages were expressed, assessed with the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. When {KBM}-7 cells were heterotransplanted into nude mice without immunosuppressive pretreatment, one of three mice injected with 1 x 10(7) cells and all mice injected with 1 x 10(8) cells developed slowly growing granulocytic sarcomas within 6-8 weeks. These tumors were locally invasive but did not metastasize. We conclude that the {KBM}-7 cell line will be of value for investigating molecular events underlying neoplastic transformation in {CML}, in particular for studying the effects of {BCR}-{ABL} and {ABL}-{BCR} on the proliferation of {CML} cells in the absence of normal {BCR} and c-{ABL} messages.},

In amyloid mouse models of {AD}, {ABCA}1 deficiency exacerbates amyloidogenesis, whereas {ABCA}1 overexpression ameliorates amyloid load, suggesting a role for {ABCA}1 in A? metabolism. Agonists of liver X receptors ({LXR}), including {GW}3965, induce transcription of several genes including {ABCA}1 and {apoE}, and reduce A? levels and improve cognition in {AD} mice. However, the specific role of {ABCA}1 in mediating beneficial responses to {LXR} agonists in {AD} mice is unknown. We evaluated behavioral and neuropathogical outcomes in {GW}3965-treated female {APP}/{PS}1 mice with and without {ABCA}1. Treatment of {APP}/{PS}1 mice with {GW}3965 increased {ABCA}1 and {apoE} protein levels. {ABCA}1 was required to observe significantly elevated {apoE} levels in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid upon therapeutic (33 mg/kg/day) {GW}3965 treatment. At 33 mg/kg/day, {GW}3965 was also associated with a trend toward redistribution of A? to the carbonate-soluble pool independent of {ABCA}1. {APP}/{PS}1 mice treated with either 2.5 or 33 mg/kg/day of {GW}3965 showed a clear trend toward reduced amyloid burden in hippocampus and whole brain, whereas {APP}/{PS}1-treated mice lacking {ABCA}1 failed to display reduced amyloid load in the whole brain and showed trends toward increased hippocampal amyloid. Treatment of {APP}/{PS}1 mice with either dose of {GW}3965 completely restored novel object recognition memory to wild-type levels, which required {ABCA}1. These results suggest that {ABCA}1 contributes to several beneficial effects of the {LXR} agonist {GW}3965 in {APP}/{PS}1 mice.},

By using metabolic labeling, we measured A?42 and A?40 production and clearance rates in the {CNS} of participants with Alzheimer’s disease and cognitively normal controls. Clearance rates for both A?42 and A?40 were impaired in Alzheimer’s disease compared with controls. On average, there were no differences in A?40 or A?42 production rates.

The protective effect of the {APOE}2 allele has been reported and also rapidly verified. No evidence exists to support the notion of linkage disequilibrium with any nearby locus on chromosome 19. The neuropathological demonstration of apolipoprotein E ({apoE}) within neuronal cytoplasm in a location suitable for proposed interaction with microtubule-associated protein tau and {MAP}2c has introduced a new view of neuronal neurobiology. As {apoE} is not known to be expressed in neurons, its relationship with cellular receptors, such as the low-density lipoprotein related receptor, and the mechanism of intracellular trafficking are now important research problems.

The pathological accumulation of oligomeric A? assemblies depresses excitatory transmission at the synaptic level, but also triggers aberrant patterns of neuronal circuit activity and epileptiform discharges at the network level. A?-induced dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons likely increases synchrony among excitatory principal cells and contributes to the destabilization of neuronal networks. Strategies that block these A? effects may prevent cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Potential obstacles and next steps toward this goal are discussed.},

Human cellular models of Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) pathogenesis would enable the investigation of candidate pathogenic mechanisms in {AD} and the testing and developing of new therapeutic strategies. We report the development of {AD} pathologies in cortical neurons generated from human induced pluripotent stem ({iPS}) cells derived from patients with Down syndrome. Adults with Down syndrome (caused by trisomy of chromosome 21) develop early-onset {AD}, probably due to increased expression of a gene on chromosome 21 that encodes the amyloid precursor protein ({APP}). We found that cortical neurons generated from {iPS} cells and embryonic stem cells from Down syndrome patients developed {AD} pathologies over months in culture, rather than years in vivo. These cortical neurons processed the transmembrane {APP} protein, resulting in secretion of the pathogenic peptide fragment amyloid-?42 (A?42), which formed insoluble intracellular and extracellular amyloid aggregates. Production of A? peptides was blocked by a ?-secretase inhibitor. Finally, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, a pathological hallmark of {AD}, was found to be localized to cell bodies and dendrites in {iPS} cell–derived cortical neurons from Down syndrome patients, recapitulating later stages of the {AD} pathogenic process.},

A long-standing question in the study of long-term memory is how a memory trace persists for years when the proteins that initiated the process turn over and disappear within days. Previously, we postulated that self-sustaining amyloidogenic oligomers of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein ({CPEB}) provide a mechanism for the maintenance of activity-dependent synaptic changes and, thus, the persistence of memory. Here, we found that the Drosophila {CPEB} Orb2 forms amyloid-like oligomers, and oligomers are enriched in the synaptic membrane fraction. Of the two protein isoforms of Orb2, the amyloid-like oligomer formation is dependent on the Orb2A form. A point mutation in the prion-like domain of Orb2A, which reduced amyloid-like oligomerization of Orb2, did not interfere with learning or memory persisting up to 24 hr. However the mutant flies failed to stabilize memory beyond 48 hr. These results support the idea that amyloid-like oligomers of neuronal {CPEB} are critical for the persistence of long-term memory.},

In males, mating increased, whereas sexual deprivation reduced, neuropeptide F ({NPF}) levels. Activation or inhibition of the {NPF} system in turn reduced or enhanced ethanol preference. These results thus link sexual experience, {NPF} system activity, and ethanol consumption. Artificial activation of {NPF} neurons was in itself rewarding and precluded the ability of ethanol to act as a reward.

However, a growing number of functional amyloids have now been described that demonstrate that amyloid formation can be an integral part of normal cellular physiology. Functional amyloid production is highly regulated, and the resulting fibers serve a variety of roles for the cells that produce them. A new role for amyloid as storage reservoirs for peptide hormones within mammalian secretory granules has been discovered. More than 30 different peptide hormones have been found to form amyloids in vitro, and both rats and mice have been shown to store hormone amyloid deposits in secretory granules. Thus, the emerging evidence adds to the diverse roles of amyloid and raises intriguing questions for both the peptide hormone and the functional amyloid fields.},

While neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and deficits in behavior and memory have all been attributed to oligomeric A?42, the specific roles for this assembly in the cellular neuropathology of {AD} remain poorly understood. In particular, lack of reliable and well-characterized forms of easily detectable A?42 oligomers has hindered study of the cellular trafficking of exogenous A?42 by neurons in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the objective of this study is to fluorescently label soluble oligomeric A?42 without altering the structure or function of this assembly. Previous studies have demonstrated the advantages of using tapping mode atomic force microscopy ({AFM}) to characterize the structural assemblies formed by synthetic A?42 under specific solution conditions (e.g., oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils). Here, we extend these methods to establish a strategy for fluorescent labeling of oligomeric A?42 assemblies that are structurally comparable to unlabeled oligomeric A?42. To compare function, we demon-strate that the uptake of labeled and unlabeled oligomeric A?42 by neurons in vitro is similar. {AFM}-characterized fluorophore-A?42 oligomers are an exciting new reagent for use in a variety of studies designed to elucidate critical cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of this A?42 assembly form in {AD}.},

Globally, termites are an extremely successful group of wood-degrading organisms1 and are therefore important both for their roles in carbon turnover in the environment and as potential sources of biochemical catalysts for efforts aimed at converting wood into biofuels. Only recently have data supported any direct role for the symbiotic bacteria in the gut of the termite in cellulose and xylan hydrolysis2. Here we use a metagenomic analysis of the bacterial community resident in the hindgut paunch of a wood-feeding ‘higher’ Nasutitermes species (which do not contain cellulose-fermenting protozoa) to show the presence of a large, diverse set of bacterial genes for cellulose and xylan hydrolysis. Many of these genes were expressed in vivo or had cellulase activity in vitro, and further analyses implicate spirochete and fibrobacter species in gut lignocellulose degradation. New insights into other important symbiotic functions including H2 metabolism, {CO}2-reductive acetogenesis and N2 fixation are also provided by this first system-wide gene analysis of a microbial community specialized towards plant lignocellulose degradation.

	abstract = {Maximum parsimony ({MP}) methods aim to reconstruct the phylogeny of extant species by finding the most parsimonious evolutionary scenario using the species' genome data. {MP} methods are considered to be accurate, but they are also computationally expensive especially for a large number of species. Several disk-covering methods ({DCMs}), which decompose the input species to multiple overlapping subgroups (or disks), have been proposed to solve the problem in a divide-and-conquer way.
        We design a new {DCM} based on the spectral method and also develop the {COGNAC} (Comparing Orders of Genes using Novel Algorithms and high-performance Computers) software package. {COGNAC} uses the new {DCM} to reduce the phylogenetic tree search space and selects an output tree from the reduced search space based on the {MP} principle. We test the new {DCM} using gene order data and inversion distance. The new {DCM} not only reduces the number of candidate tree topologies but also excludes erroneous tree topologies which can be selected by original {MP} methods. Initial labeling of internal genomes affects the accuracy of {MP} methods using gene order data, and the new {DCM} enables more accurate initial labeling as well. {COGNAC} demonstrates superior accuracy as a consequence. We compare {COGNAC} with {FastME} and the combination of the state of the art {DCM} (Rec-I-{DCM}3) and {GRAPPA} . {COGNAC} clearly outperforms {FastME} in accuracy. {COGNAC} –using the new {DCM}–also reconstructs a much more accurate tree in significantly shorter time than {GRAPPA} with Rec-I-{DCM}3.},

	abstract = {The human distal gut harbours a vast ensemble of microbes (the microbiota) that provide important metabolic capabilities, including the ability to extract energy from otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Studies of a few unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S {rRNA} genes6, 7, 8, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure. Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is used and stored3, 4, 5. Here we characterize the faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers, to address how host genotype, environmental exposure and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome. Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S {rRNA} sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes. The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person’s gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable ‘core microbiome’ at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage, level. Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiological states (obese compared with lean).},

Translocation of helicase-like proteins on nucleic acids underlies key cellular functions. However, it is still unclear how translocation can drive removal of {DNA}-bound proteins, and basic properties like the elementary step size remain controversial. Using single-molecule fluorescence analysis on a prototypical superfamily 1 helicase, Bacillus stearothermophilus {PcrA}, we discovered that {PcrA} preferentially translocates on the {DNA} lagging strand instead of unwinding the template duplex. {PcrA} anchors itself to the template duplex using the 2B subdomain and reels in the lagging strand, extruding a single-stranded loop. Static disorder limited previous ensemble studies of a {PcrA} stepping mechanism. Here, highly repetitive looping revealed that {PcrA} translocates in uniform steps of 1 nt. This reeling-in activity requires the open conformation of {PcrA} and can rapidly dismantle a preformed {RecA} filament even at low {PcrA} concentrations, suggesting a mode of action for eliminating potentially deleterious recombination intermediates.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. This amyloid primarily contains amyloid-? (A?), a 39- to 43-aa peptide derived from the proteolytic cleavage of the endogenous amyloid precursor protein. The 42-residue-length A? peptide (A?1–42), the most abundant A? peptide found in plaques, has a much greater propensity to self-aggregate into fibrils than the other peptides and is believed to be more pathogenic. Synthetic human A?1–42 peptides self-aggregate into stable but poorly-ordered helical filaments. We determined their structure to ?10-Å resolution by using {cryoEM} and the iterative real-space reconstruction method. This structure reveals 2 protofilaments winding around a hollow core. Previous hairpin-like {NMR} models for A?17–42 fit well in the {cryoEM} density map and reveal that the juxtaposed protofilaments are joined via the N terminus of the peptide from 1 protofilament connecting to the loop region of the peptide in the opposite protofilament. This model of mature A?1–42 fibrils is markedly different from previous {cryoEM} models of A?1–40 fibrils. In our model, the C terminus of A? forms the inside wall of the hollow core, which is supported by partial proteolysis analysis.},

	abstract = {Among the many surprises to arise from studies of prion biology, perhaps the most unexpected is the strain phenomenon whereby a single protein can misfold into structurally distinct, infectious states that cause distinguishable phenotypes1, 2, 3. Similarly, proteins can adopt a spectrum of conformations in non-infectious diseases of protein folding; some are toxic and others are well tolerated4. However, our understanding of the structural differences underlying prion strains and how these differences alter their physiological impact remains limited. Here we use a combination of solution {NMR}, amide hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange and mutagenesis to study the structural differences between two strain conformations, termed Sc4 and Sc37 (ref. 5), of the yeast Sup35 prion. We find that these two strains have an overlapping amyloid core spanning most of the Gln/Asn-rich first 40 amino acids that is highly protected from H/D exchange and very sensitive to mutation. These features indicate that the cores are composed of tightly packed ?-sheets possibly resembling ‘steric zipper’ structures revealed by X-ray crystallography of Sup35-derived peptides6, 7. The stable structure is greatly expanded in the Sc37 conformation to encompass the first 70 amino acids, revealing why this strain shows increased fibre stability and decreased ability to undergo chaperone-mediated replication8. Our findings establish that prion strains involve large-scale conformational differences and provide a structural basis for understanding a broad range of functional studies, including how conformational changes alter the physiological impact of prion strains.},

Most algorithms have been designed to find overrepresented motifs in sparse datasets of long sequences, and ignore most positional information. We introduce an algorithm optimized to exploit spatial information in sparse-but-populous datasets.
Results: Our algorithm Tree-based Weighted-Position Pattern Discovery and Classification (T-{WPPDC}) supports both unsupervised pattern discovery and supervised sequence classification. It identifies positionally enriched patterns using the Kullback–Leibler distance between foreground and background sequences at each position. This spatial information is used to discover positionally important patterns. T-{WPPDC} then uses a scoring function to discriminate different biological classes. We validated T-{WPPDC} on an important biological problem: prediction of single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) from flanking sequence. We evaluated 672 separate experiments on 120 datasets derived from multiple species. T-{WPPDC} outperformed other pattern discovery methods and was comparable to the supervised machine learning algorithms. The algorithm is computationally efficient and largely insensitive to dataset size. It allows arbitrary parameterization and is embarrassingly parallelizable.
Conclusions: T-{WPPDC} is a minimally parameterized algorithm for both pattern discovery and sequence classification that directly incorporates positional information. We use it to confirm the predictability of {SNPs} from flanking sequence, and show that positional information is a key to this biological problem.

We trained an unsupervised (self-organizing map) and two kernel-based classifiers, namely the support vector machine and a probabilistic neural network. Turn versus non-turn classification was carried out for turn families containing intramolecular hydrogen bonds and three to six residues. Support vector machine classifiers yielded a Matthews correlation coefficient (mcc) of ?0.6 and a prediction accuracy of 80\%. Probabilistic neural networks were developed for ?-turn type prediction. The method was able to distinguish between five types of ?-turns yielding mcc {\textgreater} 0.5 and at least 80\% overall accuracy. We conclude that the proposed new turn classification is distinct and well-defined, and machine learning classifiers are suited for sequence-based turn prediction.

Results: The comparisons we performed were as follows. (1) We compared two predictions of the pathway complements of Helicobacter pylori that were computed by an early version of our pathway-prediction algorithm: prediction A used the {EcoCyc} E. coli pathway {DB} as the reference database ({DB}) for prediction, and prediction B used the {MetaCyc} pathway {DB} (a superset of {EcoCyc}) as the reference pathway {DB}. The {MetaCyc}-based prediction contained 75\% more pathway predictions, but we believe a significant number of those predictions were false positives. (2) We compared two predictions of the pathway complement of H. pylori that used {MetaCyc} as the reference pathway {DB}, but that used different algorithms: the original {PathoLogic} algorithm, and an enhanced version of the algorithm designed to eliminate false-positive pathway predictions. The improved algorithm predicted 30{\textbackslash}\% fewer metabolic pathways than the original algorithm; all of the eliminated pathways are believed to be false-positive predictions. (3){\textasciitilde}We compared the 98 pathways predicted by the enhanced algorithm with the results of a manual analysis of the pathways of H. pylori. Results: 40 of the computationally predicted pathways were consistent with the manual analysis, 13 pathways are considered false-positive predictions, and four pathways had partially overlapping topologies. Twenty-six predicted pathways were not mentioned in the manual analysis; we believe these are correct predictions by {PathoLogic} that were not found by the manual analysis. Five pathways from the manual analysis were not found computationally. Agreement between the computational and manual predictions was good overall, with the computational analysis inferring many pathways that the manual analysis did not identify. Ultimately the manual analysis is also partially speculative, and therefore is not an absolute measure of correctness. The algorithm is designed to err on the side of more false positives to bring more potential pathways to the user's attention.

	abstract = {Summary
To achieve cell entry, many nonenveloped viruses must transform from a dormant to a primed state. In contrast to the membrane fusion mechanism of enveloped viruses (e.g., influenza virus), this membrane penetration mechanism is poorly understood. Here, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we report a 3.3 Å structure of the primed, infectious subvirion particle of aquareovirus. The density map reveals side-chain densities of all types of amino acids (except glycine), enabling construction of a full-atom model of the viral particle. Our structure and biochemical results show that priming involves autocleavage of the membrane penetration protein and suggest that Lys84 and Glu76 may facilitate this autocleavage in a nucleophilic attack. We observe a myristoyl group, covalently linked to the N terminus of the penetration protein and embedded in a hydrophobic pocket. These results suggest a well-orchestrated process of nonenveloped virus entry involving autocleavage of the penetration protein prior to exposure of its membrane-insertion finger.

	abstract = {Radiation damage is the main problem which prevents the determination of the structure of a single biological macromolecule at atomic resolution using any kind of microscopy. This is true whether neutrons, electrons or X-rays are used as the illumination. For neutrons, the cross-section for nuclear capture and the associated energy deposition and radiation damage could be reduced by using samples that are fully deuterated and 15N-labelled and by using fast neutrons, but single molecule biological microscopy is still not feasible. For naturally occurring biological material, electrons at present provide the most information for a given amount of radiation damage. Using phase contrast electron microscopy on biological molecules and macromolecular assemblies of approximately 10(5) molecular weight and above, there is in theory enough information present in the image to allow determination of the position and orientation of individual particles: the application of averaging methods can then be used to provide an atomic resolution structure. The images of approximately 10,000 particles are required. Below 10(5) molecular weight, some kind of crystal or other geometrically ordered aggregate is necessary to provide a sufficiently high combined molecular weight to allow for the alignment. In practice, the present quality of the best images still falls short of that attainable in theory and this means that a greater number of particles must be averaged and that the molecular weight limitation is somewhat larger than the predicted limit. For X-rays, the amount of damage per useful elastic scattering event is several hundred times greater than for electrons at all wavelengths and energies and therefore the requirements on specimen size and number of particles are correspondingly larger. Because of the lack of sufficiently bright neutron sources in the foreseeable future, electron microscopy in practice provides the greatest potential for immediate progress.},

The canonical conformational states occupied by most ligand-gated ion channels, and many cell-surface receptors, are the resting, activated, and desensitized states. While the resting and activated states of multiple receptors are well characterized, elaboration of the structural properties of the desensitized state, a state that is by definition inactive, has proven difficult. Here we use electrical, chemical, and crystallographic experiments on the {AMPA}-sensitive {GluR}2 receptor, defining the conformational rearrangements of the agonist binding cores that occur upon desensitization of this ligand-gated ion channel. These studies demonstrate that desensitization involves the rupture of an extensive interface between domain 1 of 2-fold related glutamate-binding core subunits, compensating for the ca. 21° of domain closure induced by glutamate binding. The rupture of the domain 1 interface allows the ion channel to close and thereby provides a simple explanation to the long-standing question of how agonist binding is decoupled from ion channel gating upon receptor desensitization.},

An {SN}-cycle is defined as a closed path on the {SN}-graph and is postulated to preferentially join functionally related gene products that participate in the same biochemical or regulatory process.

	abstract = {Motivation: When analyzing protein sequences using sequence
  similarity searches, orthologous sequences (that diverged by
  speciation) are more reliable predictors of a new protein’s
  function than paralogous sequences (that diverged by gene
  duplication), because duplication enables functional
  diversification. The utility of phylogenetic information in
  high-throughput genome annotation (‘phylogenomics’) is
  widely recognized, but existing approaches are either manual or
  indirect (e.g. not based on phylogenetic trees). Our goal is to
  automate phylogenomics using explicit phylogenetic inference. A
  necessary component is an algorithm to infer speciation and
  duplication events in a given gene tree.Results: We give an algorithm to infer speciation and duplication
  events on a gene tree by comparison to a trusted species tree. This
  algorithm has a worst-case running time of O()
  which is inferior to two previous algorithms that are
  O() for a gene tree of sequences.
  However, our algorithm is extremely simple, and its asymptotic worst
  case behavior is only realized on pathological data sets. We show
  empirically, using 1750 gene trees constructed from the Pfam protein
  family database, that it appears to be a practical (and often
  superior) algorithm for analyzing real gene trees.Availability: http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/{foresterContact}: zmasek@genetics.wustl.edu;

A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped {BLAST} program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by {BLAST} into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated {BLAST} ({PSIBLAST}) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped {BLAST}, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. {PSI}-{BLAST} is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the {BRCT} superfamily.},

	abstract = {We present an approach for assessing the significance of
 sequence and structure comparisons by using nearly identical
 statistical formalisms for both sequence and structure. Doing so
 involves an all-vs.-all comparison of protein domains [taken here from
 the Structural Classification of Proteins (scop) database] and then
 fitting a simple distribution function to the observed scores. By using
 this distribution, we can attach a statistical significance to each
 comparison score in the form of a P value, the
 probability that a better score would occur by chance. As expected, we
 find that the scores for sequence matching follow an extreme-value
 distribution. The agreement, moreover, between the P
 values that we derive from this distribution and those reported by
 standard programs (e.g., blast and fasta
 validates our approach. Structure comparison scores also follow an
 extreme-value distribution when the statistics are expressed in terms
 of a structural alignment score (essentially the sum of reciprocated
 distances between aligned atoms minus gap penalties). We find that the
 traditional metric of structural similarity, the rms deviation in atom
 positions after fitting aligned atoms, follows a different distribution
 of scores and does not perform as well as the structural alignment
 score. Comparison of the sequence and structure statistics for pairs of
 proteins known to be related distantly shows that structural comparison
 is able to detect approximately twice as many distant relationships as
 sequence comparison at the same error rate. The comparison also
 indicates that there are very few pairs with significant similarity in
 terms of sequence but not structure whereas many pairs have significant
 similarity in terms of structure but not sequence.},

This allows us to assess, understand, and improve our automatic method against an objective, manually derived standard, a type of comprehensive evaluation that has not yet been possible for other structural alignment algorithms. Our basic approach directly matches the backbones of two structures, using repeated cycles of dynamic programming and least-squares fitting to determine an alignment minimizing coordinate difference. Because of simplicity, our method can be readily modified to take into account additional features of protein structure such as the orientation of side chains or the location-dependent cost of opening a gap. Our basic method, augmented by such modifications, can find reasonable alignments for all but 1.5\% of the known structural similarities in scop, i.e., all but 32 of the 2,107 superfamily pairs. We discuss the specific protein structural features that make these 32 pairs so difficult to align and show how our procedure effectively partitions the relationships in scop into different categories, depending on what aspects of protein structure are involved (e.g., depending on whether or not consideration of side-chain orientation is necessary for proper alignment). We also show how our pairwise alignment procedure can be extended to generate a multiple alignment for a group of related structures. We have compared these alignments in detail with corresponding manual ones culled from the literature. We find good agreement (to within 95\% for the core regions), and detailed comparison highlights how particular protein structural features (such as certain strands) are problematical to align, giving somewhat ambiguous results. With these improvements and systematic tests, our procedure should be useful for the development of scop and the future classification of protein folds.

Phylogenetic methods produce hierarchies of molecular species, inferring knowledge about taxonomy and evolution. However, there is not yet a consensus methodology that provides a crisp partition of taxa, desirable when considering the problem of intra/inter-patient quasispecies classification or infection transmission event identification. We introduce the threshold bootstrap clustering ({TBC}), a new methodology for partitioning molecular sequences, that does not require a phylogenetic tree estimation.

Methodology/Principal Findings
The {TBC} is an incremental partition algorithm, inspired by the stochastic Chinese restaurant process, and takes advantage of resampling techniques and models of sequence evolution. {TBC} uses as input a multiple alignment of molecular sequences and its output is a crisp partition of the taxa into an automatically determined number of clusters. By varying initial conditions, the algorithm can produce different partitions. We describe a procedure that selects a prime partition among a set of candidate ones and calculates a measure of cluster reliability. {TBC} was successfully tested for the identification of type-1 human immunodeficiency and hepatitis C virus subtypes, and compared with previously established methodologies. It was also evaluated in the problem of {HIV}-1 intra-patient quasispecies clustering, and for transmission cluster identification, using a set of sequences from patients with known transmission event histories.

Conclusion
{TBC} has been shown to be effective for the subtyping of {HIV} and {HCV}, and for identifying intra-patient quasispecies. To some extent, the algorithm was able also to infer clusters corresponding to events of infection transmission. The computational complexity of {TBC} is quadratic in the number of taxa, lower than other established methods; in addition, {TBC} has been enhanced with a measure of cluster reliability. The {TBC} can be useful to characterise molecular quasipecies in a broad context.},

The presence of biologically relevant functional modules in these networks has been theorized by many researchers. However, the application of traditional clustering algorithms for extracting these modules has not been successful, largely due to the presence of noisy false positive interactions as well as specific topological challenges in the network.Results: In this article, we propose an ensemble clustering framework to address this problem. For base clustering, we introduce two topology-based distance metrics to counteract the effects of noise. We develop a {PCA}-based consensus clustering technique, designed to reduce the dimensionality of the consensus problem and yield informative clusters. We also develop a soft consensus clustering variant to assign multifaceted proteins to multiple functional groups. We conduct an empirical evaluation of different consensus techniques using topology-based, information theoretic and domain-specific validation metrics and show that our approaches can provide significant benefits over other state-of-the-art approaches. Our analysis of the consensus clusters obtained demonstrates that ensemble clustering can (a) produce improved biologically significant functional groupings; and (b) facilitate soft clustering by discovering multiple functional associations for proteins.Contact: srini@cse.ohio-state.{eduSupplementary} information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The three dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C?-C? distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non hydrogen atoms.

An important class of protein interactions in critical cellular processes, such as signaling pathways, involves a domain from one protein binding to a linear peptide stretch of another. Many methods identify peptides mediating such interactions but without details of how the interactions occur, even when excellent structural information is available for the unbound protein. Experimental studies are currently time consuming, while existing computational methods to predict protein–peptide structures mostly focus on interactions involving specific protein families. Here, we present a general approach for predicting protein–peptide interaction sites. We show that spatial atomic position specific scoring matrices of binding sites for each peptide residue can capture the properties important for binding and when used to scan the surface of target proteins can accurately identify candidate binding sites for interacting peptides. The resulting predictions are highly illuminating for several recently described protein–peptide complexes, including {RG}-rich peptides with {SMN} domains, the Epstein-Barr virus {LMP}1 with {TRADD} domains, {DBC}1 with Sir2, and the Ago hook with the Argonaute {PIWI} domain. The accurate prediction of protein–peptide binding without prior structural knowledge will ultimately enable better functional characterization of many protein interactions involved in vital biological processes and provide a better picture of cellular mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Prions are unprecedented infectious pathogens that cause a group of
 invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases by an entirely novel
 mechanism. Prion diseases may present as genetic, infectious, or
 sporadic disorders, all of which involve modification of the prion
 protein ({PrP}). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy ({BSE}), scrapie of
 sheep, and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease ({CJD}) of humans are among the
 most notable prion diseases. Prions are transmissible particles that
 are devoid of nucleic acid and seem to be composed exclusively of a
 modified protein ({PrPSc}). The normal, cellular {PrP}
 ({PrPC}) is converted into {PrPSc} through a
 posttranslational process during which it acquires a high ?-sheet
 content. The species of a particular prion is encoded by the sequence
 of the chromosomal {PrP} gene of the mammals in which it last replicated.
 In contrast to pathogens carrying a nucleic acid genome, prions appear
 to encipher strain-specific properties in the tertiary structure of
 {PrPSc}. Transgenetic studies argue that {PrPSc}
 acts as a template upon which {PrPC} is refolded into a
 nascent {PrPSc} molecule through a process facilitated by
 another protein. Miniprions generated in transgenic mice expressing
 {PrP}, in which nearly half of the residues were deleted, exhibit unique
 biological properties and should facilitate structural studies of
 {PrPSc}. While knowledge about prions has profound
 implications for studies of the structural plasticity of proteins,
 investigations of prion diseases suggest that new strategies for the
 prevention and treatment of these disorders may also find application
 in the more common degenerative diseases.},

Overproduction of Ure2p increased the frequency with which a strain became [{URE}3] by 100-fold.

In contrast to men, women showed little category specificity on either the genital or the subjective measure. Both heterosexual and homosexual women experienced strong genital arousal to both male and female sexual stimuli. Transsexuals showed a category-specific pattern, demonstrating that category specificity can be detected in the neovagina using a photoplethysmographic measure of female genital sexual arousal.

Avery et al. 1944). Four decades later, the discovery that a protein could mimic viral and bacterial pathogens with respect to the transmission of some nervous system diseases (
Prusiner 1982) met with great resistance. Overwhelming evidence now shows that Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease ({CJD}) and related disorders are caused by prions. The prion diseases are characterized by neurodegeneration and lethality. In mammals, prions reproduce by recruiting the normal, cellular isoform of the prion protein ({PrPC}) and stimulating its conversion into the disease-causing isoform ({PrPSc}). {PrPC} and {PrPSc} have distinct conformations: {PrPC} is rich in ?-helical content and has little ?-sheet structure, whereas {PrPSc} has less ?-helical content and is rich in ?-sheet structure (
Pan et al. 1993). The conformational conversion of {PrPC} to {PrPSc} is the fundamental event underlying prion diseases. In this article, we provide an introduction to prions and the diseases they cause.},

Overexpression of just the amino-terminal 65 residues of Ure2p increased the frequency of [{URE}3] induction 6000-fold. Without this “prion-inducing domain” the carboxyl-terminal domain performed the nitrogen regulation function of Ure2p, but could not be changed to the [{URE}3] prion state.

In the past 3 years, researchers have achieved the ‘Holy Grail’ demonstration that infectious material can be generated in vitro using completely defined components. These breakthroughs have proven that a misfolded protein is the active component of the infectious agent, and that propagation of the disease and its unique features depend on the self-replication of the infectious folding of the prion protein. In spite of these important discoveries, it remains unclear whether another molecule besides the misfolded prion protein might be an essential element of the infectious agent. Future research promises to reveal many more intriguing features about the rogue prions.},

With the discovery of possible prion-like phenomena in this disease supposedly driven by cell-autonomous processes, an evaluation of the similarities and differences between tau-driven neurodegeneration and prion disease becomes necessary.

The field of prion science has provided an alternative mechanism whereby a seed of pathologically misfolded protein, arising exogenously or through a rare endogenous structural fluctuation, yields a template to catalyze misfolding of the native protein. The misfolded protein may then spread intercellularly to communicate the misfold to adjacent areas and ultimately infect a whole tissue. Mounting evidence implicates a prion-like process in the propagation of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the tauopathies. However, the parallels between the events observed in these conditions and those in prion disease are often incomplete. The aim of this review was to examine the current state of knowledge concerning the mechanisms of protein misfolding and aggregation for neurodegeneration-associated proteins. In addition, possible methods of intercellular spread are described that focus on the hypothesis that released microvesicles function as misfolded protein delivery vehicles, and the therapeutic options enabled by viewing these diseases from the prion perspective.},

	abstract = {Summary
Prions are proteins that can assume at least two distinct conformational states, one of which is dominant and self-perpetuating. Previously we found that a translation regulator {CPEB} from Aplysia, {ApCPEB}, that stabilizes activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy can display prion-like properties in yeast. Here we find that, when exogenously expressed in sensory neurons, {ApCPEB} can form an amyloidogenic self-sustaining multimer, consistent with it being a prion-like protein. In addition, we find that conversion of both the exogenous and the endogenous {ApCPEB} to the multimeric state is enhanced by the neurotransmitter serotonin and that an antibody that recognizes preferentially the multimeric {ApCPEB} blocks persistence of synaptic facilitation. These results are consistent with the idea that {ApCPEB} can act as a self-sustaining prion-like protein in the nervous system and thereby might allow the activity-dependent change in synaptic efficacy to persist for long periods of time.

Conformational flexibility of the {ATP}-binding site in the {CDK}2 and {ERK}2 kinases was identified using molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energy (?G) of twenty-four {ATP}-competitive inhibitors toward these kinases was assessed using an alchemical free energy perturbation method, {MP}-{CAFEE}. However, large calculation errors of 2–3 kcal/mol were observed using this method, where the free energy simulation starts from a single equilibrated conformation. Here, we developed a new ?G computation method, where the starting structure was set to multiconformations to cover flexibility. The calculation accuracy was successfully improved, especially for larger molecular size compounds, leading to reliable prediction of a broader range of drug candidates. The present study demonstrates that conformational flexibility of interactions between a compound and the glycine-rich loop in the kinases is a key factor in ?G estimation.},

	abstract = {Multistate computational protein design ({MSD}) with backbone ensembles approximating conformational flexibility can predict higher quality sequences than single-state design with a single fixed backbone. However, it is currently unclear what characteristics of backbone ensembles are required for the accurate prediction of protein sequence stability. In this study, we aimed to improve the accuracy of protein stability predictions made with {MSD} by using a variety of backbone ensembles to recapitulate the experimentally measured stability of 85 Streptococcal protein G domain ?1 sequences. Ensembles tested here include an {NMR} ensemble as well as those generated by molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations, by Backrub motions, and by {PertMin}, a new method that we developed involving the perturbation of atomic coordinates followed by energy minimization. {MSD} with the {PertMin} ensembles resulted in the most accurate predictions by providing the highest number of stable sequences in the top 25, and by correctly binning sequences as stable or unstable with the highest success rate (?90\%) and the lowest number of false positives. The performance of {PertMin} ensembles is due to the fact that their members closely resemble the input crystal structure and have low potential energy. Conversely, the {NMR} ensemble as well as those generated by {MD} simulations at 500 or 1000 K reduced prediction accuracy due to their low structural similarity to the crystal structure. The ensembles tested herein thus represent on- or off-target models of the native protein fold and could be used in future studies to design for desired properties other than stability.

Alternate conformations in sub-1 Å crystal structures show backrub motions for two-thirds of the significant C? shifts and 3\% of the total residues in these proteins (126/3882), accompanied by two-state changes in sidechain rotamer. The Backrub modeling tool is effective in crystallographic rebuilding. For homology modeling or protein redesign, backrubs can provide realistic, small perturbations to rigid backbones.

One key property of proteins is their flexibility—their intrinsic ability to adopt different conformations. This flexibility can be measured experimentally but the measurements are indirect and computational models are required to interpret them. Here we develop a new computational method for interpreting these measurements of flexibility and use it to create a model of flexibility of the protein ubiquitin. We apply our results to show relationships between the flexibility of one protein and the diversity of structures and amino acid sequences of the protein's evolutionary family. Thus, our results show that more accurate computational modeling of protein flexibility is useful for improving prediction of a broader range of amino acid sequences compatible with a given protein. Our method will be helpful for advancing methods to rationally engineer protein functions by enabling sampling of conformational and sequence diversity similar to that of a protein's evolutionary family.},

We show that the predictions are enriched in functional proteins when compared to a phage display screen quantitatively mapping the energy landscape for the interaction between human growth hormone and its receptor. Our model for structural plasticity is inspired by coupled side chain-backbone “backrub” motions observed in high-resolution protein crystal structures. Although the modeled structural changes are subtle, our results on predicting sequence plasticity suggest that backrub sampling may capture a sizable fraction of localized conformational changes that occur in proteins.

	abstract = {Motivation: Mutations in homologous proteins affect changes in the backbone conformation that involve a complex interplay of forces which are difficult to predict. Protein design algorithms need to anticipate these backbone changes in order to accurately calculate the energy of the structure given an amino acid sequence, without knowledge of the final, designed sequence. This is related to the problem of predicting small changes in the backbone between highly similar sequences. Results: We explored the ability of the Rosetta suite of protein design tools to move the backbone from its position in one structure (template) to its position in a close homologous structure (target) as a function of the diversity of a backbone ensemble constructed using the template structure, the percent sequence identity between the template and target, and the size of local zone being considered in the ensemble. We describe a pareto front in the likelihood of moving the backbone toward the target as a function of ensemble diversity and zone size. The equations and protocols presented here will be useful for protein design.

	abstract = {Accurate modeling of biomolecular systems requires accurate forcefields. Widely used molecular mechanics ({MM}) forcefields obtain parameters from experimental data and quantum chemistry calculations on small molecules but do not have a clear way to take advantage of the information in high-resolution macromolecular structures. In contrast, knowledge-based methods largely ignore the physical chemistry of interatomic interactions, and instead derive parameters almost exclusively from macromolecular structures. This can involve considerable double counting of the same physical interactions. Here, we describe a method for forcefield improvement that combines the strengths of the two approaches. We use this method to improve the Rosetta all-atom forcefield, in which the total energy is expressed as the sum of terms representing different physical interactions as in {MM} forcefields and the parameters are tuned to reproduce the properties of macromolecular structures. To resolve inaccuracies resulting from possible double counting of interactions, we compare distribution functions from low-energy modeled structures to those from crystal structures. The structural and physical bases of the deviations between the modeled and reference structures are identified and used to guide forcefield improvements. We describe improvements resolving double counting between backbone hydrogen bond interactions and Lennard-Jones interactions in helices; between sidechain-backbone hydrogen bonds and the backbone torsion potential; and between the sidechain torsion potential and Lennard-Jones interactions. Discrepancies between computed and observed distributions are also used to guide the incorporation of an explicit C?-hydrogen bond in ? sheets. The method can be used generally to integrate different sources of information for forcefield improvement. Proteins 2011; © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are governed by the change in free energy upon binding, ?G = ?H ? {T?S}. These interactions are often marginally stable, so one must examine the balance between the change in enthalpy, ?H, and the change in entropy, ?S, when investigating known complexes, characterizing the effects of mutations, or designing optimized variants. To perform a large-scale study into the contribution of conformational entropy to binding free energy, we developed a technique called {GOBLIN} (Graphical {mOdel} for {BiomoLecular} {INteractions}) that performs physics-based free energy calculations for protein-protein complexes under both side-chain and backbone flexibility. {GOBLIN} uses a probabilistic graphical model that exploits conditional independencies in the Boltzmann distribution and employs variational inference techniques that approximate the free energy of binding in only a few minutes. We examined the role of conformational entropy on a benchmark set of more than 700 mutants in eight large, well-studied complexes. Our findings suggest that conformational entropy is important in protein-protein interactions—the root mean square error ({RMSE}) between calculated and experimentally measured ??Gs decreases by 12\% when explicit entropic contributions were incorporated. {GOBLIN} models all atoms of the protein complex and detects changes to the binding entropy along the interface as well as positions distal to the binding interface. Our results also suggest that a variational approach to entropy calculations may be quantitatively more accurate than the knowledge-based approaches used by the well-known programs {FOLDX} and {ROSETTA}—{GOBLIN}'s {RMSEs} are 10 and 36\% lower than these programs, respectively.

Here, we explore the possibility of deriving atomic and residue contact potentials directly from experimental binding free energy changes following mutation and present a number of such potentials.

The second set is calculated using a weighting scheme optimized against absolute binding affinity data, so as to account for the over-representation of certain complexes, residues, and families of interactions. The congruence of the potentials with known physical chemistry is investigated. The potentials are further validated by ranking and clustering protein–protein docking poses.},

Missense mutations in structural genes may become either selectively advantageous or disadvantageous to the organism by affecting protein stability and/or interfering with interactions between partners. Thus, the ability to predict the impact of mutations on protein stability and interactions is of significant value, particularly in understanding the effects of Mendelian and somatic mutations on the progression of disease. Here, we propose a novel approach to the study of missense mutations, called {mCSM}, which relies on graph-based signatures. These encode distance patterns between atoms and are used to represent the protein residue environment and to train predictive models. To understand the roles of mutations in disease, we have evaluated their impacts not only on protein stability but also on protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid interactions.Results: We show that {mCSM} performs as well as or better than other methods that are used widely. The {mCSM} signatures were successfully used in different tasks demonstrating that the impact of a mutation can be correlated with the atomic-distance patterns surrounding an amino acid residue. We showed that {mCSM} can predict stability changes of a wide range of mutations occurring in the tumour suppressor protein p53, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method in a challenging disease scenario.Availability and implementation: A web server is available at http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/mcsm.Contact:dpires@dcc.ufmg.br; tom@cryst.bioc.cam.ac.{ukSupplementary} information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {The ability to manipulate protein binding affinities is important for the development of proteins as biosensors, industrial reagents, and therapeutics. We have developed a structure-based method to rationally predict single mutations at protein–protein interfaces that enhance binding affinities. The protocol is based on the premise that increasing buried hydrophobic surface area and/or reducing buried hydrophilic surface area will generally lead to enhanced affinity if large steric clashes are not introduced and buried polar groups are not left without a hydrogen bond partner. The procedure selects affinity enhancing point mutations at the protein–protein interface using three criteria: (1) the mutation must be from a polar amino acid to a non-polar amino acid or from a non-polar amino acid to a larger non-polar amino acid, (2) the free energy of binding as calculated with the Rosetta protein modeling program should be more favorable than the free energy of binding calculated for the wild-type complex and (3) the mutation should not be predicted to significantly destabilize the monomers. The performance of the computational protocol was experimentally tested on two separate protein complexes; G?i1 from the heterotrimeric G-protein system bound to the {RGS}14 {GoLoco} motif, and the E2, {UbcH}7, bound to the E3, E6AP from the ubiquitin pathway. Twelve single-site mutations that were predicted to be stabilizing were synthesized and characterized in the laboratory. Nine of the 12 mutations successfully increased binding affinity with five of these increasing binding by over 1.0 kcal/mol. To further assess our approach we searched the literature for point mutations that pass our criteria and have experimentally determined binding affinities. Of the eight mutations identified, five were accurately predicted to increase binding affinity, further validating the method as a useful tool to increase protein–protein binding affinities.},

Achieving high-affinity binding is important for expanding detection limits, extending dissociation half-times, decreasing drug dosages and increasing drug efficacy. However, antibody-affinity maturation in vivo often fails to produce antibody drugs of the targeted potency, making further affinity maturation in vitro by directed evolution or computational design necessary. Here we present an iterative computational design procedure that focuses on electrostatic binding contributions and single mutants. By combining multiple designed mutations, a tenfold affinity improvement to 52 {pM} was engineered into the anti–epidermal growth factor receptor drug cetuximab (Erbitux), and a 140-fold improvement in affinity to 30 {pM} was obtained for the anti-lysozyme model antibody D44.1. The generality of the methods was further demonstrated through identification of known affinity-enhancing mutations in the therapeutic antibody bevacizumab (Avastin) and the model anti-fluorescein antibody 4-4-20. These results demonstrate computational capabilities for enhancing and accelerating the development of protein reagents and therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Few proteins carry out their tasks in isolation. Instead, proteins combine with each other in complicated ways that can be affected by either the natural genetic variation that occurs among people or by disease causing mutations such as those that occur in cancer or in genetic disorders. To understand how these mutations affect our health, it is necessary to understand how mutations can affect the strength of the interactions that bind proteins together. This is a difficult task to do in a laboratory on a large scale and scientists are increasingly turning to computational methods to predict these effects in advance. We show that by looking at the multiple alignments of similar protein-protein complex structures at the interface regions, new constraints based on the evolution of the three dimensional structures of proteins can be made to predict which mutations are compatible with two proteins interacting and which are not.},

Changes to protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) interfaces can affect the formation of multiprotein complexes, and consequently lead to disruptions in interconnected networks of {PPIs} within and between cells, further leading to phenotypic changes as functional interactions are created or disrupted. Mutations altering {PPIs} have been linked to the development of genetic diseases including cancer and rare Mendelian diseases, and to the development of drug resistance. The importance of these protein mutations has led to the development of many resources for understanding and predicting their effects. We propose that a better understanding of how these mutations affect the structure, function, and formation of multiprotein complexes provides novel opportunities for tackling them, including the development of small-molecule drugs targeted specifically to mutated {PPIs}.},

One key property of proteins is their flexibility—their intrinsic ability to adopt different conformations. This flexibility can be measured experimentally but the measurements are indirect and computational models are required to interpret them. Here we develop a new computational method for interpreting these measurements of flexibility and use it to create a model of flexibility of the protein ubiquitin. We apply our results to show relationships between the flexibility of one protein and the diversity of structures and amino acid sequences of the protein's evolutionary family. Thus, our results show that more accurate computational modeling of protein flexibility is useful for improving prediction of a broader range of amino acid sequences compatible with a given protein. Our method will be helpful for advancing methods to rationally engineer protein functions by enabling sampling of conformational and sequence diversity similar to that of a protein's evolutionary family.},

	abstract = {The considerable flexibility of side-chains in folded proteins is important for protein stability and function, and may have a role in mediating allosteric interactions. While sampling side-chain degrees of freedom has been an integral part of several successful computational protein design methods, the predictions of these approaches have not been directly compared to experimental measurements of side-chain motional amplitudes. In addition, protein design methods frequently keep the backbone fixed, an approximation that may substantially limit the ability to accurately model side-chain flexibility. Here, we describe a Monte Carlo approach to modeling side-chain conformational variability and validate our method against a large dataset of methyl relaxation order parameters derived from nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) experiments (17 proteins and a total of 530 data points). We also evaluate a model of backbone flexibility based on Backrub motions, a type of conformational change frequently observed in ultra-high-resolution X-ray structures that accounts for correlated side-chain backbone movements. The fixed-backbone model performs reasonably well with an overall rmsd between computed and predicted side-chain order parameters of 0.26. Notably, including backbone flexibility leads to significant improvements in modeling side-chain order parameters for ten of the 17 proteins in the set. Greater accuracy of the flexible backbone model results from both increases and decreases in side-chain flexibility relative to the fixed-backbone model. This simple flexible-backbone model should be useful for a variety of protein design applications, including improved modeling of protein–protein interactions, design of proteins with desired flexibility or rigidity, and prediction of correlated motions within proteins.},

	abstract = {Summary.? Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood ({REML}) to generalized cross-validation ({GCV}) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing {REML} or marginal likelihood ({ML}) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models ({GLMs}) use iterative {REML} or {ML} estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the {GLM}. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of {GCV}, or related criteria, for the {GLM} itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for {REML} or {ML} estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate {REML} or {ML} for any {GLM}, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This {REML} or {ML} criterion requires that Newton–Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for {GLM} fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The {REML} or {ML} criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new {REML} and {ML} methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to {GCV} or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and {GCV} are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as {GCV} or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous {REML}- or {ML}-based approaches for penalized {GLMs} and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

	abstract = {While the prediction of a native protein structure from sequence continues to remain a challenging problem, over the past decades computational methods have become quite successful in exploiting the mechanisms behind secondary structure formation. The great effort expended in this area has resulted in the development of a vast number of secondary structure prediction methods. Especially the combination of well-optimized/sensitive machine-learning algorithms and inclusion of homologous sequence information has led to increased prediction accuracies of up to 80\%. In this chapter, we will first introduce some basic notions and provide a brief history of secondary structure prediction advances. Then a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art prediction methods will be given. Finally, we will discuss open questions and challenges in this field and provide some practical recommendations for the user.},

	abstract = {A Gaussian solvent-exclusion model for the solvation free energy is developed. It is based on theoretical considerations and parametrized with experimental data. When combined with the {CHARMM} 19 polar hydrogen energy function, it provides an effective energy function ({EEF}1) for proteins in solution. The solvation model assumes that the solvation free energy of a protein molecule is a sum of group contributions, which are determined from values for small model compounds. For charged groups, the self-energy contribution is accounted for primarily by the exclusion model. Ionic side-chains are neutralized, and a distance-dependent dielectric constant is used to approximate the charge–charge interactions in solution. The resulting {EEF}1 is subjected to a number of tests. Molecular dynamics simulations at room temperature of several proteins in their native conformation are performed, and stable trajectories are obtained. The deviations from the experimental structures are similar to those observed in explicit water simulations. The calculated enthalpy of unfolding of a polyalanine helix is found to be in good agreement with experimental data. Results reported elsewhere show that {EEF}1 clearly distinguishes correctly from incorrectly folded proteins, both in static energy evaluations and in molecular dynamics simulations and that unfolding pathways obtained by high-temperature molecular dynamics simulations agree with those obtained by explicit water simulations. Thus, this energy function appears to provide a realistic first approximation to the effective energy hypersurface of proteins. Proteins 1999;35:133–152. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

An essential element is the recognition that a bias toward the native state over much of the effective energy surface may govern the folding process. This has replaced the random search paradigm of Levinthal and suggests that there are many ways of reaching the native state in a reasonable time so that a specific pathway does not have to be postulated. The change in perception is due primarily to the application of statistical mechanical models and lattice simulations to protein folding. Examples of lattice model results on protein folding are presented. It is pointed out that the new optimism about the protein folding problem must be complemented by more detailed studies to determine the structural and energetic factors that introduce the biases which make possible the folding of real proteins.},

Environment and residue pair specific contributions to the scoring functions appear as the first two terms in a series expansion for the residue probability distributions in the protein database; the decoupling of the distance and environment dependencies of the distributions resolves the major problems with current database-derived scoring functions noted by Thomas and Dill. The simulated annealing procedure rapidly and frequently generates native-like structures for small helical proteins and better than random structures for small ? sheet containing proteins. Most of the simulated structures have native-like solvent accessibility and secondary structure patterns, and thus ensembles of these structures provide a particularly challenging set of decoys for evaluating scoring functions. We investigate the effects of multiple sequence information and different types of conformational constraints on the overall performance of the method, and the ability of a variety of recently developed scoring functions to recognize the native-like conformations in the ensembles of simulated structures.},

	abstract = {Some protein design tasks cannot be modeled by the traditional single state design strategy of finding a sequence that is optimal for a single fixed backbone. Such cases require multistate design, where a single sequence is threaded onto multiple backbones (states) and evaluated for its strengths and weaknesses on each backbone. For example, to design a protein that can switch between two specific conformations, it is necessary to to find a sequence that is compatible with both backbone conformations. We present in this paper a generic implementation of multistate design that is suited for a wide range of protein design tasks and demonstrate in silico its capabilities at two design tasks: one of redesigning an obligate homodimer into an obligate heterodimer such that the new monomers would not homodimerize, and one of redesigning a promiscuous interface to bind to only a single partner and to no longer bind the rest of its partners. Both tasks contained negative design in that multistate design was asked to find sequences that would produce high energies for several of the states being modeled. Success at negative design was assessed by computationally redocking the undesired protein-pair interactions; we found that multistate design's accuracy improved as the diversity of conformations for the undesired protein-pair interactions increased. The paper concludes with a discussion of the pitfalls of negative design, which has proven considerably more challenging than positive design.},

Favorable interactions between disembodied amino acid residues and the target surface are identified and used to anchor de novo designed interfaces. The method was used to design proteins that bind a conserved surface patch on the stem of the influenza hemagglutinin ({HA}) from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus. After affinity maturation, two of the designed proteins, {HB}36 and {HB}80, bind H1 and H5 {HAs} with low nanomolar affinity. Further, {HB}80 inhibits the {HA} fusogenic conformational changes induced at low {pH}. The crystal structure of {HB}36 in complex with 1918/H1 {HA} revealed that the actual binding interface is nearly identical to that in the computational design model. Such designed binding proteins may be useful for both diagnostics and therapeutics.
Proteins can be designed that bind to specific patches on target proteins to alter their subsequent interactions.

As many regulatory proteins are modular, considerable progress in engineering signaling circuits has been made by recombining commonly occurring domains. Our ability to predictably engineer cellular functions, however, is constrained by complex crosstalk observed in naturally occurring domains. Here we demonstrate a strategy for improving and simplifying protein network engineering: using computational design to create orthogonal (non-crossreacting) protein-protein interfaces. We validated the design of the interface between a key signaling protein, the {GTPase} Cdc42, and its activator, Intersectin, biochemically and by solving the crystal structure of the engineered complex. The designed {GTPase} ({orthoCdc}42) is activated exclusively by its engineered cognate partner ({orthoIntersectin}), but maintains the ability to interface with other {GTPase} signaling circuit components in vitro. In mammalian cells, {orthoCdc}42 activity can be regulated by {orthoIntersectin}, but not wild-type Intersectin, showing that the designed interaction can trigger complex processes. Computational design of protein interfaces thus promises to provide specific components that facilitate the predictable engineering of cellular functions.},

Five amino acid substitutions 1) enhance the hydrophobicity and packing of residues surrounding Glu-34 of {ICAM}-1, which coordinates to a Mg2+ in the {LFA}-1 I domain, and 2) alter associations at the edges of the binding interface. The affinity of the most improved {ICAM}-1 mutant for intermediate- and high-affinity {LFA}-1 I domains was increased by 19-fold and 22-fold, respectively, relative to wild type. Moreover, potency was similarly enhanced for inhibition of {LFA}-1-dependent ligand binding and cell adhesion. Thus, rational design can be used to engineer novel adhesion molecules with high monomeric affinity; furthermore, the {ICAM}-1 mutant holds promise for targeting {LFA}-1-{ICAM}-1 interaction for biological studies and therapeutic purposes.},

Three previous {NKG}2D-ligand complex structures show the homodimeric receptor interacting with the monomeric ligands in similar 2:1 complexes, with an equivalent surface on each {NKG}2D monomer binding intimately to a total of six distinct ligand surfaces. Here, the crystal structure of free human {NKG}2D and in silico and in vitro alanine-scanning mutagenesis analyses of the complex interfaces indicate that {NKG}2D recognition degeneracy is not explained by a classical induced-fit mechanism. Rather, the divergent ligands appear to utilize different strategies to interact with structurally conserved elements of the consensus {NKG}2D binding site.},

We have determined the crystal structure of human leukemia inhibitory factor ({LIF}) bound to the cytokine binding region ({CHR}) of gp130 at 2.5 Å resolution. Strikingly, we find that the shared binding site on gp130 has an entirely rigid core, while the {LIF} binding interface diverges sharply in structure and chemistry from that of other gp130 ligands. Dissection of the {LIF}-gp130 interface, along with comparative studies of other gp130 cytokines, reveal that gp130 has evolved a “thermodynamic plasticity” that is relatively insensitive to ligand structure, to enable crossreactivity. These observations reveal a novel and alternative mechanism for degenerate recognition from that of structural plasticity.},

We describe a massively parallel approach for designing, manufacturing and screening mini-protein binders, integrating large-scale computational design, oligonucleotide synthesis, yeast display screening and next-generation sequencing. We designed and tested 22,660 mini-proteins of 37–43 residues that target influenza haemagglutinin and botulinum neurotoxin B, along with 6,286 control sequences to probe contributions to folding and binding, and identified 2,618 high-affinity binders. Comparison of the binding and non-binding design sets, which are two orders of magnitude larger than any previously investigated, enabled the evaluation and improvement of the computational model. Biophysical characterization of a subset of the binder designs showed that they are extremely stable and, unlike antibodies, do not lose activity after exposure to high temperatures. The designs elicit little or no immune response and provide potent prophylactic and therapeutic protection against influenza, even after extensive repeated dosing.},

	abstract = {Loss of side-chain conformational entropy is an important force opposing protein folding and the relative preferences of the amino acids for being buried or solvent exposed may be partially determined by which amino acids lose more side-chain entropy when placed in the core of a protein. To investigate these preferences, we have incorporated explicit modeling of side-chain entropy into the protein design algorithm, {RosettaDesign}. In the standard version of the program, the energy of a particular sequence for a fixed backbone depends only on the lowest energy side-chain conformations that can be identified for that sequence. In the new model, the free energy of a single amino acid sequence is calculated by evaluating the average energy and entropy of an ensemble of structures generated by Monte Carlo sampling of amino acid side-chain conformations. To evaluate the impact of including explicit side-chain entropy, sequences were designed for 110 native protein backbones with and without the entropy model. In general, the differences between the two sets of sequences are modest, with the largest changes being observed for the longer amino acids: methionine and arginine. Overall, the identity between the designed sequences and the native sequences does not increase with the addition of entropy, unlike what is observed when other key terms are added to the model (hydrogen bonding, Lennard-Jones energies, and solvation energies). These results suggest that side-chain conformational entropy has a relatively small role in determining the preferred amino acid at each residue position in a protein.

Solvent molecules interact intimately with proteins and can profoundly regulate their structure and function. However, accurately and efficiently modeling protein solvation effects at the molecular level has been challenging. Here, we present a method that improves the atomic-level modeling of soluble and membrane protein structures and binding by efficiently predicting de novo protein-solvent molecule interactions. The method predicted with unprecedented accuracy buried water molecule positions, solvated protein conformations, and challenging mutational effects on protein binding. When applied to homology modeling, solvent-bound membrane protein structures, pockets, and cavities were recapitulated with near-atomic precision even from distant homologs. Blindly refined atomic-level structures of evolutionary distant G protein-coupled receptors imply strikingly different functional roles of buried solvent between receptor classes. The method should prove useful for refining low-resolution protein structures, accurately modeling drug-binding sites in structurally uncharacterized receptors, and designing solvent-mediated protein catalysis, recognition, ligand binding, and membrane protein signaling.},
