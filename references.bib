	abstract = {Although Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MC}) simulation is a potentially powerful approach for exploring conformational space, it has been unable to compete with molecular dynamics ({MD}) in the analysis of high density structural states, such as the native state of globular proteins. Here, we introduce a kinetic algorithm, {CRISP}, that greatly enhances the sampling efficiency in all-atom {MC} simulations of dense systems. The algorithm is based on an exact analytical solution to the classic chain-closure problem, making it possible to express the interdependencies among degrees of freedom in the molecule as correlations in a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate that our method reproduces structural variation in proteins with greater efficiency than current state-of-the-art Monte Carlo methods and has real-time simulation performance on par with molecular dynamics simulations. The presented results suggest our method as a valuable tool in the study of molecules in atomic detail, offering a potential alternative to molecular dynamics for probing long time-scale conformational transitions.},

Given a set of sequence alignments, {RosettaCM} assembles topologies by recombining aligned segments in Cartesian space and building unaligned regions de novo in torsion space. The junctions between segments are regularized using a loop closure method combining fragment superposition with gradient-based minimization. The energies of the resulting models are optimized by all-atom refinement, and the most representative low-energy model is selected.

The factors governing their affinity remain however elusive, especially when it comes to describing dissociation rates (koff). Here we demonstrate that, next to direct contributions from the interface, also the non-interacting surface plays an important role in binding affinity, especially polar and charged residues. Their percentage on the non-interacting surface is conserved over orthologous complexes indicating an evolutionary selection pressure. Their effect on binding affinity can be explained by long-range electrostatics contributions and surface-solvent interactions that are known to determine the local frustration of the protein complex surface. Including these in a simple model significantly improves the affinity prediction of protein complexes from structural models. The impact of mutations outside the interacting surface on binding affinity is supported by experimental alanine scanning mutagenesis data. These results enable the development of more sophisticated and integrated biophysical models of binding affinity and open new directions in experimental control and modulation of biomolecular interactions.},

This review highlights recent successes in applying new or improved protein engineering strategies toward the design of improved enzymes and enzymes with new activities. We focus on three approaches: structure-guided protein design, computational design, and the use of novel scaffolding and compartmentalization techniques to improve performance of multienzyme systems. Examples described address problems relating to enzyme specificity, stability, and/or activity, or aim to balance sequential reactions and route intermediates by co-localizing multiple enzymes. Specific applications include improving production of biofuels using enzymes with altered cofactor specificity, production of high-value chiral compounds by enzymes with tailored substrate specificities, and accelerated cellulose degradation via multi-enzyme scaffold assemblies. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a growing variety of computational and molecular biology tools. Continued advances on these fronts coupled with better mindfulness of how to apply proteins in unique ways offer exciting prospects for future protein engineering and biocatalysis research.

After analyses of codon content and relative synonymous codon usages were checked by the Bonferroni correction, we found five codons, with three ({AUA}, {AGA}, and {AGG}) correlating positively and two ({CGU} and {AGC}) correlating negatively with the Topt value. The three positive codons are purine-rich codons, and the two negative codons have A-ends. The two negative codons are pyridine-rich codons, and one has a C-end. Comparable with the codon C- and A-ending features, C- and A-content within {mRNA} correlated negatively and positively with the Topt value, respectively. Thereby, codons have effects on enzyme thermal property. When the issue is analyzed at the residual level, the effect of codon message is lost.

	abstract = {There have been considerable attempts in the past to relate phenotypic trait—habitat temperature of organisms—to their genotypes, most importantly compositions of their genomes and proteomes. However, despite accumulation of anecdotal evidence, an exact and conclusive relationship between the former and the latter has been elusive. We present an exhaustive study of the relationship between amino acid composition of proteomes, nucleotide composition of {DNA}, and optimal growth temperature ({OGT}) of prokaryotes. Based on 204 complete proteomes of archaea and bacteria spanning the temperature range from −10 °C to 110 °C, we performed an exhaustive enumeration of all possible sets of amino acids and found a set of amino acids whose total fraction in a proteome is correlated, to a remarkable extent, with the {OGT}. The universal set is Ile, Val, Tyr, Trp, Arg, Glu, Leu ({IVYWREL}), and the correlation coefficient is as high as 0.93. We also found that the G + C content in 204 complete genomes does not exhibit a significant correlation with {OGT} (R = −0.10). On the other hand, the fraction of A + G in coding {DNA} is correlated with temperature, to a considerable extent, due to codon patterns of {IVYWREL} amino acids. Further, we found strong and independent correlation between {OGT} and the frequency with which pairs of A and G nucleotides appear as nearest neighbors in genome sequences. This adaptation is achieved via codon bias. These findings present a direct link between principles of proteins structure and stability and evolutionary mechanisms of thermophylic adaptation. On the nucleotide level, the analysis provides an example of how nature utilizes codon bias for evolutionary adaptation to extreme conditions. Together these results provide a complete picture of how compositions of proteomes and genomes in prokaryotes adjust to the extreme conditions of the environment.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional lattice model of a protein is used to investigate the properties required for its folding to the native state. The polypeptide chain is represented as a 27 bead heteropolymer whose lowest energy (native) state can be determined by an exhaustive enumeration of all fully compact conformations. A total of 260 sequences with random interactions are generated and subjected to Monte Carlo simulations to determine which chains find the ground state in a short time; i.e. which sequences overcome the folding problem referred to as the Levinthal paradox. Comparison of the folding and non-folding sequences is used to identify the features that are required for fast folding to the global energy minimum. It is shown that successful folding does not require certain attributes that have been previously proposed as necessary for folding; these include a high number of short versus long-range contacts in the native state, a high content of the secondary structure in the native state, a strong correlation between the native contact map and the interaction parameters, and the existence of a high number of low energy states with near-native conformation. Instead, the essential difference between the folding and the non-folding sequences is the nature of the energy spectrum. The necessary and sufficient condition for a sequence to fold rapidly in the present model is that the native state is a pronounced energy minimum. As a consequence, the thermodynamic stability of the native state of a folding sequence has a sigmoidal dependence on temperature. This permits such a sequence to satisfy both the thermodynamic and the kinetic requirements for folding; i.e. the native state predominates thermodynamically at temperatures that are high enough for folding to be kinetically possible. The applicability of the present results to real proteins is discussed.},

These fundamental principles of protein design are manifested in the “from both ends of the hydrophobicity scale” trend observed in thermophilic adaptation, whereby proteomes of thermophilic proteins are enriched in extreme amino acids—hydrophobic and charged—at the expense of polar ones.

The question is then if side-chain charges, due to their desolvation penalties, play a corresponding role in protein folding by avoiding competing, misfolded traps? To find out, we removed all 32 side-chain charges from the 101-residue protein S6 from Thermus thermophilus. The results show that the charge-depleted S6 variant not only retains its native structure and cooperative folding transition, but folds also faster than the wild-type protein. In addition, charge removal unleashes pronounced aggregation on longer timescales. S6 provides thus an example where the bias toward native contacts of a naturally evolved protein sequence is independent of charges, and point at a fundamental difference in the codes for folding and intermolecular interaction: specificity in folding is governed primarily by hydrophobic packing and hydrogen bonding, whereas solubility and binding relies critically on the interplay of side-chain charges.},

Attempts to rationally design ligand-binding proteins have met with little success, however, and the computational design of protein–small-molecule interfaces remains an unsolved problem. Current approaches for designing ligand-binding proteins for medical and biotechnological uses rely on raising antibodies against a target antigen in immunized animals and/or performing laboratory-directed evolution of proteins with an existing low affinity for the desired ligand, neither of which allows complete control over the interactions involved in binding. Here we describe a general computational method for designing pre-organized and shape complementary small-molecule-binding sites, and use it to generate protein binders to the steroid digoxigenin ({DIG}). Of seventeen experimentally characterized designs, two bind {DIG}; the model of the higher affinity binder has the most energetically favourable and pre-organized interface in the design set. A comprehensive binding-fitness landscape of this design, generated by library selections and deep sequencing, was used to optimize its binding affinity to a picomolar level, and X-ray co-crystal structures of two variants show atomic-level agreement with the corresponding computational models. The optimized binder is selective for {DIG} over the related steroids digitoxigenin, progesterone and β-oestradiol, and this steroid binding preference can be reprogrammed by manipulation of explicitly designed hydrogen-bonding interactions. The computational design method presented here should enable the development of a new generation of biosensors, therapeutics and diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Protein loop closure constitutes a critical step in loop and protein modeling whereby geometrically feasible loops must be found between two given anchor residues. Here, a new analytic/iterative algorithm denoted random coordinate descent ({RCD}) to perform protein loop closure is described. The algorithm solves loop closure through minimization as in cyclic coordinate descent but selects bonds for optimization randomly, updates loop conformations by spinor-matrices, performs loop closure in both chain directions, and uses a set of geometric filters to yield efficient conformational sampling. Geometric filters allow one to detect clashes and constrain dihedral angles on the fly. The {RCD} algorithm is at least comparable to state of the art loop closure algorithms due to an excellent balance between efficiency and intrinsic sampling capability. Furthermore, its efficiency allows one to improve conformational sampling by increasing the sampling number without much penalty. Overall, {RCD} turns out to be accurate, fast, robust, and applicable over a wide range of loop lengths. Because of the versatility of {RCD}, it is a solid alternative for integration with current loop modeling strategies.},

	abstract = {A key component of computational biology is to compare the results of computer modelling with experimental measurements. Despite substantial progress in the models and algorithms used in many areas of computational biology, such comparisons sometimes reveal that the computations are not in quantitative agreement with experimental data. The principle of maximum entropy is a general procedure for constructing probability distributions in the light of new data, making it a natural tool in cases when an initial model provides results that are at odds with experiments. The number of maximum entropy applications in our field has grown steadily in recent years, in areas as diverse as sequence analysis, structural modelling, and neurobiology. In this Perspectives article, we give a broad introduction to the method, in an attempt to encourage its further adoption. The general procedure is explained in the context of a simple example, after which we proceed with a real-world application in the field of molecular simulations, where the maximum entropy procedure has recently provided new insight. Given the limited accuracy of force fields, macromolecular simulations sometimes produce results that are at not in complete and quantitative accordance with experiments. A common solution to this problem is to explicitly ensure agreement between the two by perturbing the potential energy function towards the experimental data. So far, a general consensus for how such perturbations should be implemented has been lacking. Three very recent papers have explored this problem using the maximum entropy approach, providing both new theoretical and practical insights to the problem. We highlight each of these contributions in turn and conclude with a discussion on remaining challenges.},

An important aspect of the increased complexity of the folding process in the cellular environment is that proteins tend to be metastable against aggregation, as they are often expressed at levels at which they are poorly soluble. The maintenance of the solubility of the proteome requires the coordinated intervention of a range of quality control mechanisms, which include molecular chaperones, trafficking and degradation pathways, post-translational modifications and transcriptional and translational control. As these regulatory mechanisms should always be active to keep proteins in their soluble state, their impairment upon ageing or environmental stress can lead to the disruption of protein homeostasis resulting in uncontrolled widespread aggregation and disease.},

Each step in protein production has the potential to cause aggregation as proteins, not evolved to exist outside the cell, endure the various steps involved in commercial manufacturing processes. Mechanistic studies into protein aggregation have revealed that certain sequence regions contribute more to the aggregation propensity of a protein than other sequence regions do. Efforts to disrupt these regions have thus far indicated that rational sequence engineering is a useful technique to reduce the aggregation of biotechnologically relevant proteins. To improve our ability to rationally engineer proteins with enhanced expression, solubility, and shelf-life we conducted extensive analyses of aggregation prone regions ({APRs}) within protein sequences to characterize the various roles these regions play in proteins. Findings from this work indicate that protein sequences have evolved by minimizing their aggregation propensities. However, we also found that many {APRs} are conserved in protein families and are essential to maintain protein stability and function. Therefore, the contributions that {APRs}, targeted for disruption, make towards protein stability and function should be carefully evaluated when improving protein solubility via rational design.},

The {ERBIN}-binding site in {ERBB}2/{HER}2 has a critical role in restricting this receptor to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, as mutation of the {ERBIN}-binding site leads to the mislocalization of the receptor in these cells.

	abstract = {Protein–protein recognition, frequently mediated by members of large families of interaction domains, is one of the cornerstones of biological function. Here, we present a computational, structure-based method to predict the sequence space of peptides recognized by {PDZ} domains, one of the largest families of recognition proteins. As a test set, we use a considerable amount of recent phage display data that describe the peptide recognition preferences for 169 naturally occurring and engineered {PDZ} domains. For both wild-type {PDZ} domains and single point mutants, we find that 70–80\% of the most frequently observed amino acids by phage display are predicted within the top five ranked amino acids. Phage display frequently identified recognition preferences for amino acids different from those present in the original crystal structure. Notably, in about half of these cases, our algorithm correctly captures these preferences, indicating that it can predict mutations that increase binding affinity relative to the starting structure. We also find that we can computationally recapitulate specificity changes upon mutation, a key test for successful forward design of protein–protein interface specificity. Across all evaluated data sets, we find that incorporation backbone sampling improves accuracy substantially, irrespective of using a crystal or {NMR} structure as the starting conformation. Finally, we report successful prediction of several amino acid specificity changes from blind tests in the {DREAM}4 peptide recognition domain specificity prediction challenge. Because the foundational methods developed here are structure based, these results suggest that the approach can be more generally applied to specificity prediction and redesign of other protein–protein interfaces that have structural information but lack phage display data.},

Identification of the most efficient search methods is essential if we are to be able to apply such methods broadly and with confidence. In addition, efficient search methods provide a rigorous test of existing energy functions, which are generally knowledge-based and contain different terms added together with arbitrary weights. Here, we test different search methods with one of the most accurate and predictive energy functions, namely Rosetta the knowledge-based force-field from Baker's group [Simons K, Kooperberg C, Huang E, Baker D (1997) J Mol Biol 268:209–225]. We use an implementation of a generalized ensemble search method to scale relevant parts of the energy function. This method, known as Hamiltonian Replica Exchange Monte Carlo, outperforms the original Monte Carlo Simulated Annealing used in the Rosetta package in terms of sampling low-energy states. It also outperforms another widely used generalized ensemble search method known as Temperature Replica Exchange Monte Carlo. Our results reveal clear deficiencies in the low-resolution Rosetta energy function in that the lowest energy structures are not necessarily the most native-like. By using a set of nonnative low-energy structures found by our extensive sampling, we discovered that the long-range and short-range backbone hydrogen-bonding energy terms of the Rosetta energy discriminate between the nonnative and native-like structures significantly better than the low-resolution score used in Rosetta.},

Differential scanning calorimetry has been used to measure the reversible unfolding transitions for the proteins in both heme oxidation states. Reduction potentials have been measured as a function of temperature for the folded forms of the proteins. The combination of measurements of thermal stability and reduction potential gives three sides of a thermodynamic cycle and allows prediction of the reduction potential of the thermally unfolded state. The free energies of electron binding for the thermally unfolded proteins differ from those expected for a fully unfolded protein, suggesting that residual structure modulates the reduction potential. At temperatures near 50 °C the N52I mutation has a small but significant effect on oxidation state-sensitive structure in the thermally unfolded protein. Inspection of the high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of iso-2 and N52I iso-2 shows that the effects of the N52I mutation and oxidation state on native protein stability are correlated with changes in the mobility of specific polypeptide chain segments and with altered hydrogen bonding involving a conserved water molecule. However, there is no clear explanation of oxidation state or mutation-induced differences in stability of the proteins in terms of observed changes in structure and mobility of the folded forms of the proteins alone.},

Designs were considered a success if a high-resolution crystal structure of the complex closely matched the design model and the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding was less than 10 μM. The successes and failures represent a wide variety of interface types and design goals including heterodimers, homodimers, peptide-protein interactions, one-sided designs (i.e., where only one of the proteins was mutated) and two-sided designs. The most striking feature of the successful designs is that they have fewer polar atoms at their interfaces than many of the failed designs. Designs that attempted to create extensive sets of interface-spanning hydrogen bonds resulted in no detectable binding. In contrast, polar atoms make up more than 40\% of the interface area of many natural dimers, and native interfaces often contain extensive hydrogen bonding networks. These results suggest that Rosetta may not be accurately balancing hydrogen bonding and electrostatic energies against desolvation penalties and that design processes may not include sufficient sampling to identify side chains in preordered conformations that can fully satisfy the hydrogen bonding potential of the interface.},

	abstract = {Summary 
Apoptosis is a conserved cellular pathway that results in the activation of cysteine-aspartyl proteases, or caspases. To dissect the nonredundant roles of the executioner caspase-3, -6, and -7 in orchestrating apoptosis, we have developed an orthogonal protease to selectively activate each isoform in human cells. Our approach uses a split-tobacco etch virus ({TEV}) protease under small-molecule control, which we call the {SNIPer}, with caspase alleles containing genetically encoded {TEV} cleavage sites. These studies reveal that all three caspases are transiently activated but only activation of caspase-3 or -7 is sufficient to induce apoptosis. Proteomic analysis shown here and from others reveals that 20 of the 33 subunits of the 26S proteasome can be cut by caspases, and we demonstrate synergy between proteasome inhibition and dose-dependent caspase activation. We propose a model of proteolytic reciprocal negative regulation with mechanistic implications for the combined clinical use of proteasome inhibitors and proapoptotic drugs.

Inhibitors of Apoptosis Protein ({IAPs}) are guardian ubiquitin ligases that keep classic proapoptotic proteins in check. Systematic identification of additional {IAP} substrates is challenged by the heterogeneity and sheer number of ubiquitinated proteins (\&gt;5,000). Here we report a powerful catalytic tagging tool, the {NEDDylator}, which fuses a {NEDD}8 E2-conjugating enzyme, Ubc12, to the ubiquitin ligase, {XIAP} or {cIAP}1. This permits transfer of the rare ubiquitin homolog {NEDD}8 to the ubiquitin E3 substrates, allowing them to be efficiently purified for {LC}-{MS}/{MS} identification. We have identified \&gt;50 potential {IAP} substrates of both cytosolic and mitochondrial origin that bear hallmark N-terminal {IAP} binding motifs. These substrates include the recently discovered protein phosphatase {PGAM}5, which we show is proteolytically processed, accumulates in cytosol during apoptosis, and sensitizes cells to death. These studies reveal mechanisms and antagonistic partners for specific {IAPs}, and provide a powerful technology for labeling binding partners in transient protein-protein complexes.},

High-level production of non-native isoprenoid products requires that {FPP} flux be diverted from production of sterols to the heterologous metabolic reactions. To do so, expression of the gene encoding squalene synthase ({ERG}9), the first committed step in sterol biosynthesis, was down-regulated by replacing its native promoter with the methionine-repressible {MET}3 promoter. The intracellular levels of {FPP} were then assayed by expressing the gene encoding amorphadiene synthase ({ADS}) and converting the {FPP} to amorphadiene. Under certain culture conditions amorphadiene production increased fivefold upon {ERG}9 repression. With increasing flux to amorphadiene, squalene and ergosterol production each decreased. The levels of these three metabolites were dependent not only upon the level of {ERG}9 repression, but also the timing of its repression relative to the induction of {ADS} and genes responsible for enhancing flux to {FPP}.

Because of the vast size and extreme ruggedness of conformational space, even close to the native structure, the high-resolution sampling problem is almost as difficult as predicting the rough fold of a protein. Here, we present a combination of new algorithms that considerably speed up the exploration of very rugged conformational landscapes and are capable of finding heretofore hidden low-energy states. The algorithm is based on a hierarchical workflow and can be parallelized on supercomputers with up to 128,000 compute cores with near perfect efficiency. Such scaling behavior is notable, as with Moore's law continuing only in the number of cores per chip, parallelizability is a critical property of new algorithms.

	abstract = {Because the space of folded protein structures is highly degenerate, with recurring secondary and tertiary motifs, methods for representing protein structure in terms of collective physically relevant coordinates are of great interest. By collapsing structural diversity to a handful of parameters, such methods can be used to delineate the space of designable structures (i.e., conformations that can be stabilized with a large number of sequences)—a crucial task for de novo protein design. We first demonstrate this on natural α-helical coiled coils using the Crick parameterization. We show that over 95\% of known coiled-coil structures are within  1-Å Cα root mean square deviation of a Crick-ideal backbone. Derived parameters show that natural geometric space of coiled coils is highly restricted and can be represented by “allowed” conformations amidst a potential continuum of conformers. Allowed structures have (1) restricted axial offsets between helices, which differ starkly between parallel and anti-parallel structures; (2) preferred superhelical radii, which depend linearly on the oligomerization state; (3) pronounced radius-dependent a- and d-position amino acid propensities; and (4) discrete angles of rotation of helices about their axes, which are surprisingly independent of oligomerization state or orientation. In all, we estimate the space of designable coiled-coil structures to be reduced at least 160-fold relative to the space of geometrically feasible structures. To extend the benefits of structural parameterization to other systems, we developed a general mathematical framework for parameterizing arbitrary helical structures, which reduces to the Crick parameterization as a special case. The method is successfully validated on a set of non-coiled-coil helical bundles, frequent in channels and transporter proteins, which show significant helix bending but not supercoiling. Programs for coiled-coil parameter fitting and structure generation are provided via a web interface at http://www.gevorggrigoryan.com/cccp/, and code for generalized helical parameterization is available upon request.},

Designing predetermined crystal structures can be subtle given the complexity of proteins and the noncovalent interactions that govern crystallization. De novo protein design provides an approach to engineer highly complex nanoscale molecular structures, and often the positions of atoms can be programmed with sub-Å precision. Herein, a computational approach is presented for the design of proteins that self-assemble in three dimensions to yield macroscopic crystals. A three-helix coiled-coil protein is designed de novo to form a polar, layered, three-dimensional crystal having the P6 space group, which has a “honeycomb-like” structure and hexameric channels that span the crystal. The approach involves: (i) creating an ensemble of crystalline structures consistent with the targeted symmetry; (ii) characterizing this ensemble to identify “designable” structures from minima in the sequence-structure energy landscape and designing sequences for these structures; (iii) experimentally characterizing candidate proteins. A 2.1 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of one such designed protein exhibits sub-Å agreement [backbone root mean square deviation (rmsd)] with the computational model of the crystal. This approach to crystal design has potential applications to the de novo design of nanostructured materials and to the modification of natural proteins to facilitate X-ray crystallographic analysis.},

Essential to its various functions is its ability to bind simultaneously to two different proteins, {FKBP} and {mTOR}. Despite its widespread use, a thorough analysis of the interactions between {FKBP}, rapamycin, and the rapamycin-binding domain of {mTOR}, {FRB}, is lacking. To probe the affinities involved in the formation of the {FKBP}·rapamycin·{FRB} complex, we used fluorescence polarization, surface plasmon resonance, and {NMR} spectroscopy. Analysis of the data shows that rapamycin binds to {FRB} with moderate affinity (Kd = 26 ± 0.8 ?M). The {FKBP}12·rapamycin complex, however, binds to {FRB} 2000-fold more tightly (Kd = 12 ± 0.8 {nM}) than rapamycin alone. No interaction between {FKBP} and {FRB} was detected in the absence of rapamycin. These studies suggest that rapamycin's ability to bind to {FRB}, and by extension to {mTOR}, in the absence of {FKBP} is of little consequence under physiological conditions. Furthermore, protein?protein interactions at the {FKBP}12?{FRB} interface play a role in the stability of the ternary complex.},

	abstract = {Computational protein design aims at constructing novel or improved functions on the structure of a given protein backbone and has important applications in the pharmaceutical and biotechnical industry. The underlying combinatorial side-chain placement ({SCP}) problem consists of choosing a {SCP} for each residue position such that the resulting overall energy is minimum. The choice of the side-chain then also determines the amino acid for this position. Many algorithms for this {NP}\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{{NP}\}\} -hard problem have been proposed in the context of homology modeling, which, however, reach their limits when faced with large protein design instances. In this paper, we propose a new exact method for the {SCP} problem that works well even for large instance sizes as they appear in protein design. Our main contribution is a dedicated branch-and-bound algorithm that combines tight upper and lower bounds resulting from a novel Lagrangian relaxation approach for {SCP}. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms alternative state-of-the-art exact approaches and makes it possible to optimally solve large protein design instances routinely.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryThe} human body is a complex ecosystem where microbes compete, and cooperate. These interactions can support health or promote disease, e.g. in dental plaque formation. The Human Microbiome Project collected and sequenced ca. 5,000 samples from 18 different body sites, including the airways, gut, skin, oral cavity and vagina. These data allowed the first assessment of significant patterns of co-presence and exclusion among human-associated bacteria. We combined sparse regression with an ensemble of similarity measures to predict microbial relationships within and between body sites. This captured known relationships in the dental plaque, vagina, and gut, and also predicted novel interactions involving members of under-characterized phyla such as {TM}7. We detected relationships necessary for plaque formation and differences in community composition among dominant members of the gut and vaginal microbiomes. Most relationships were strongly niche-specific, with only a few hub microorganisms forming links across multiple body areas. We also found that phylogenetic distance had a strong impact on the interaction type: closely related microorganisms co-occurred within the same niche, whereas most exclusive relationships occurred between more distantly related microorganisms. This establishes both the specific organisms and general principles by which microbial communities associated with healthy humans are assembled and maintained.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, {microRNA} regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

However, it remains very challenging to account for backbone conformational changes during docking, and most current methods inherently keep monomer backbones rigid for algorithmic simplicity and computational efficiency. Here we present a reformulation of the Rosetta docking method that incorporates explicit backbone flexibility in protein–protein docking. The new method is based on a “fold-tree” representation of the molecular system, which seamlessly integrates internal torsional degrees of freedom and rigid-body degrees of freedom. Problems with internal flexible regions ranging from one or more loops or hinge regions to all of one or both partners can be readily treated using appropriately constructed fold trees. The explicit treatment of backbone flexibility improves both sampling in the vicinity of the native docked conformation and the energetic discrimination between near-native and incorrect models.},

We present a new, multilevel approach to beta-sheet structure prediction that circumvents this difficulty by reformulating structure generation in terms of a folding tree. Nonlocal connections in this tree allow us to explicitly sample alternative beta-strand pairings while simultaneously exploring local conformational space using backbone torsion-space moves. An iterative, energy-biased resampling strategy is used to explore the space of beta-strand pairings; we expect that such a strategy will be generally useful for searching large conformational spaces with a high degree of combinatorial complexity.

Imposing the constraint that at the junction of two such units the bond angle between the bonds CαN and CαC is fixed at some prescribed value θ results in a system of three bivariate polynomials in ui ≔ tan τi/2 of degree 2 in each variable. The system is analyzed for the existence of common solutions by making use of resultants, determinants of matrices composed of the coefficients of two (or more) polynomials, whose vanishing is a necessary and sufficient condition for the polynomials to have a common root. Two resultants are compared: the classical Sylvester resultant and the Dixon resultant. It is shown that when two of the variables are eliminated in favor of the third, a polynomial of degree 16 results. To each one of its real roots, there is a corresponding common zero of the system. To each such zero, there corresponds a consistent conformation of the chain. The Sylvester method can find these zeros among the eigenvalues of a 24 × 24 matrix. For the Dixon approach, after removing extraneous factors, an optimally sized eigenvalue problem of size 16 × 16 results. Finally, the easy extension to the more general problem of triaxial loop closure is presented and an algorithm for implementing the method on arbitrary chains is given. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Incorporation of effective backbone sampling into protein simulation and design is an important step in increasing the accuracy of computational protein modeling. Recent analysis of high-resolution crystal structures has suggested a new model, termed backrub, to describe localized, hinge-like alternative backbone and side-chain conformations observed in the crystal lattice. The model involves internal backbone rotations about axes between C-alpha atoms. Based on this observation, we have implemented a backrub-inspired sampling method in the Rosetta structure prediction and design program. We evaluate this model of backbone flexibility using three different tests. First, we show that Rosetta backrub simulations recapitulate the correlation between backbone and side-chain conformations in the high-resolution crystal structures upon which the model was based. As a second test of backrub sampling, we show that backbone flexibility improves the accuracy of predicting point-mutant side-chain conformations over fixed backbone rotameric sampling alone. Finally, we show that backrub sampling of triosephosphate isomerase loop 6 can capture the millisecond/microsecond oscillation between the open and closed states observed in solution. Our results suggest that backrub sampling captures a sizable fraction of localized conformational changes that occur in natural proteins. Application of this simple model of backbone motions may significantly improve both protein design and atomistic simulations of localized protein flexibility.},

In our maps, each domain is represented by a point, and the distance between any two points approximates the structural distance between their corresponding domains. We use these maps to study the spatial distributions of properties of proteins, and in particular those of local vicinities in structure space such as structural density and functional diversity. These maps provide a unique broad view of protein space and thus reveal previously undescribed fundamental properties thereof. At the same time, the maps are consistent with previous knowledge (e.g., domains cluster by their {SCOP} class) and organize in a unified, coherent representation previous observation concerning specific protein folds. To investigate the function–structure relationship, we measure the functional diversity (using the Gene Ontology controlled vocabulary) in local structural vicinities. Our most striking finding is that functional diversity varies considerably across structure space: The space has a highly diverse region, and diversity abates when moving away from it. Interestingly, the domains in this region are mostly alpha/beta structures, which are known to be the most ancient proteins. We believe that our unique perspective of structure space will open previously undescribed ways of studying proteins, their evolution, and the relationship between their structure and function.},

For 131 orphan enzymes (37\% of those for which (meta)genomic neighbours are available), we associate sequences to them using scoring parameters with an estimated accuracy of 70\%, implying functional annotation of 16 345 gene sequences in numerous (meta)genomes. As a case in point, two of these candidate sequences were experimentally validated to encode the predicted activity.

In applications to models produced using nuclear magnetic resonance data and to comparative models based on distant structural homologues, the method can significantly improve the accuracy of the structures in terms of both the backbone conformations and the placement of core side chains. Furthermore, the resulting models satisfy a particularly stringent test: they provide significantly better solutions to the X-ray crystallographic phase problem in molecular replacement trials. Finally, we show that all-atom refinement can produce de novo protein structure predictions that reach the high accuracy required for molecular replacement without any experimental phase information and in the absence of templates suitable for molecular replacement from the Protein Data Bank. These results suggest that the combination of high-resolution structure prediction with state-of-the-art phasing tools may be unexpectedly powerful in phasing crystallographic data for which molecular replacement is hindered by the absence of sufficiently accurate previous models.},

Its action is mediated by the {PYR}/{PYL}/{RCAR} family of {START} proteins, but it remains unclear how these receptors bind {ABA} and, in turn, how hormone binding leads to inhibition of the downstream type 2C protein phosphatase ({PP}2C) effectors. Here we report crystal structures of apo and {ABA}-bound receptors as well as a ternary {PYL}2–{ABA}–{PP}2C complex. The apo receptors contain an open ligand-binding pocket flanked by a gate that closes in response to {ABA} by way of conformational changes in two highly conserved β-loops that serve as a gate and latch. Moreover, {ABA}-induced closure of the gate creates a surface that enables the receptor to dock into and competitively inhibit the {PP}2C active site. A conserved tryptophan in the {PP}2C inserts directly between the gate and latch, which functions to further lock the receptor in a closed conformation. Together, our results identify a conserved gate–latch–lock mechanism underlying {ABA} signalling.},

Within plants, the {PYR}/{PYL}/{RCAR} family of {START} proteins receives {ABA} to inhibit the phosphatase activity of the group-A protein phosphatases 2C ({PP}2Cs), which are major negative regulators in {ABA} signalling. Here we present the crystal structures of the {ABA} receptor {PYL}1 bound with (+)-{ABA}, and the complex formed by the further binding of (+)-{ABA}-bound {PYL}1 with the {PP}2C protein {ABI}1. {PYL}1 binds (+)-{ABA} using the {START}-protein-specific ligand-binding site, thereby forming a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the closed lid. (+)-{ABA}-bound {PYL}1 tightly interacts with a {PP}2C domain of {ABI}1 by using the hydrophobic pocket to cover the active site of {ABI}1 like a plug.

The assignment of enzyme function in functionally diverse superfamilies represents a particular challenge, which we address through a combination of computational predictions, enzymology, and structural biology. Here we describe the results of a focused investigation of a group of enzymes in the enolase superfamily that are involved in epimerizing dipeptides. The first members of this group to be functionally characterized were Ala-Glu epimerases in Eschericiha coli and Bacillus subtilis, based on the operon context and enzymological studies; these enzymes are presumed to be involved in peptidoglycan recycling. We have subsequently studied more than 65 related enzymes by computational methods, including homology modeling and metabolite docking, which suggested that many would have divergent specificities;, i.e., they are likely to have different (unknown) biological roles. In addition to the Ala-Phe epimerase specificity reported previously, we describe the prediction and experimental verification of: (i) a new group of presumed Ala-Glu epimerases; (ii) several enzymes with specificity for hydrophobic dipeptides, including one from Cytophaga hutchinsonii that epimerizes D-Ala-D-Ala; and (iii) a small group of enzymes that epimerize cationic dipeptides. Crystal structures for certain of these enzymes further elucidate the structural basis of the specificities. The results highlight the potential of computational methods to guide experimental characterization of enzymes in an automated, large-scale fashion.},

These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks.

These data, which are too sparse for conventional methods, serve only to guide conformational search toward the lowest-energy conformations in the folding landscape; the details of the computed models are determined by the physical chemistry implicit in the Rosetta all-atom energy function. The new method is not hindered by the deuteration required to suppress nuclear relaxation processes for proteins greater than 15 kilodaltons and should enable routine {NMR} structure determination for larger proteins.},

	abstract = {Proteins are inherently plastic molecules, whose function often critically depends on excursions between different molecular conformations (conformers). However, a rigorous understanding of the relation between a protein/'s structure, dynamics and function remains elusive. This is because many of the conformers on its energy landscape are only transiently formed and marginally populated (less than a few per cent of the total number of molecules), so that they cannot be individually characterized by most biophysical tools. Here we study a lysozyme mutant from phage T4 that binds hydrophobic molecules and populates an excited state transiently (about 1 ms) to about 3\% at 25 °C (ref. 5). We show that such binding occurs only via the ground state, and present the atomic-level model of the /`invisible/', excited state obtained using a combined strategy of relaxation-dispersion {NMR} (ref. 6) and {CS}-Rosetta model building that rationalizes this observation. The model was tested using structure-based design calculations identifying point mutants predicted to stabilize the excited state relative to the ground state. In this way a pair of mutations were introduced, inverting the relative populations of the ground and excited states and altering function. Our results suggest a mechanism for the evolution of a protein/'s function by changing the delicate balance between the states on its energy landscape. More generally, they show that our approach can generate and validate models of excited protein states.},

We have systematically investigated the association of multiple types of {ENCODE} data with disease-associated {SNPs} and show that there is significant enrichment for functional {SNPs} among the currently identified associations. This enrichment is strongest when integrating multiple sources of functional information and when highest confidence disease-associated {SNPs} are used. We propose an approach that integrates multiple types of functional data generated by the {ENCODE} Consortium to help identify “functional {SNPs}” that may be associated with the disease phenotype. Our approach generates putative functional annotations for up to 80\% of all previously reported associations. We show that for most associations, the functional {SNP} most strongly supported by experimental evidence is a {SNP} in linkage disequilibrium with the reported association rather than the reported {SNP} itself.

Nonetheless, designed enzymes can be improved by directed evolution, as recently exemplified for the designed Kemp eliminase {KE}07. Random mutagenesis and screening resulted in variants with \&gt; 200-fold higher catalytic efficiency and provided insights about features missing in the designed enzyme. Here we describe the optimization of {KE}70, another designed Kemp eliminase. Amino acid substitutions predicted to improve catalysis in design calculations involving extensive backbone sampling were individually tested. Those proven beneficial were combinatorially incorporated into the originally designed {KE}70 along with random mutations, and the resulting libraries were screened for improved eliminase activity. Nine rounds of mutation and selection resulted in \&gt; 400-fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency of the original {KE}70 design, reflected in both higher kcat values and lower Km values, with the best variants exhibiting kcat/Km values of \&gt; 5 × 104 s− 1 M− 1. The optimized {KE}70 variants were characterized structurally and biochemically, providing insights into the origins of the improvements in catalysis. Three primary contributions were identified: first, the reshaping of the active-site cavity to achieve tighter substrate binding; second, the fine-tuning of electrostatics around the catalytic His-Asp dyad; and, third, the stabilization of the active-site dyad in a conformation optimal for catalysis.},

More impressively, there are several cases in which Rosetta has been used to predict structures with atomic level accuracy better than 2.5 Å. In addition to de novo structure prediction, Rosetta also has methods for molecular docking, homology modeling, determining protein structures from sparse experimental {NMR} or {EPR} data, and protein design. Rosetta has been used to accurately design a novel protein structure, predict the structure of protein?protein complexes, design altered specificity protein?protein and protein?{DNA} interactions, and stabilize proteins and protein complexes. Most recently, Rosetta has been used to solve the X-ray crystallographic phase problem.
The objective of this review is to enable researchers to use the software package Rosetta for biochemical and biomedicinal studies. We provide a brief review of the six most frequent research problems tackled with Rosetta. For each of these six tasks, we provide a tutorial that illustrates a basic Rosetta protocol.

	abstract = {This article describes a method for solving the geometric closure problem for simplified models of nucleic acid structures by using the constant bond lengths approximation. The resulting chain breakage/closure equations, formulated in the space of variable torsion and bond angles, are easy to solve, and have only two solutions. The analytical simplicity is in contrast with the high complexity of the closure problem in the torsion angle space with at most 16 solutions, which has been dealt with by several authors and was solved analytically by Wu and Deem (J. Chem. Phys. 1999, 111, 6625). The discussion on the choice of variables and associated Jacobians is focussed on the question of how conformational equilibration is affected in Monte Carlo simulations of molecular systems. In addition to the closure of the phosphate backbone, it is necessary to also solve the closure problem for the five-membered flexible furanose sugar ring. Explicit closure equations and the resulting Jacobians are given both for the complete four-variable model of the furanose ring and simulations in the phase-amplitude space of the five-membered ring, which are based on the approximate two-variable model of furanose introduced by Gabb et al. (J. Comput. Chem. 1995, 16, 667). The suggested closure algorithm can be combined with collective variables defined by translations and rotations of the monomeric nucleotide units. In comparison with simple internal coordinate moves, the resulting concerted moves describe local structural changes that have high acceptance rates and enable fast conformational equilibration. Appropriate molecular models are put forward for prospective Monte Carlo simulations of nucleic acids, but can be easily adapted to other biomolecular systems, such as proteins and lipid structures in biological membranes. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Summary
Abscisic acid ({ABA}) controls many physiological processes and mediates adaptive responses to abiotic stresses. The {ABA} signaling mechanisms for abscisic acid receptors {PYR}/{PYL}/{RCAR} ({PYLs}) were reported. However, it remains unclear whether the molecular mechanisms are suitable for other {PYLs}. Here, complex structures of {PYL}3 with (+)-{ABA}, pyrabactin and {HAB}1 are reported. An unexpected trans-homodimer intermediate observed in the crystal is confirmed in solution. {ABA}-bound {PYL}3 greatly promotes the generation of monomeric {PYL}3, which can excessively increase the efficiency of inhibiting {PP}2Cs. Structure-guided biochemical experiments show that Ser195 accounts for the key intermediate. Interestingly, pyrabactin binds to {PYL}3 in a distinct nonproductive mode with gate closure, which sheds light on the design of agonists and antagonists for abscisic acid receptors. According to different conformations of ligand-bound {PYLs}, the {PYLs} family can be divided into three subclasses, among which the trans-dimeric subclass, represented by {PYL}3, reveals a distinct regulatory mechanism.},

Here we describe a new method that addresses the second problem and couples changes in the structure of the protein backbone and of the amino acid side chains, the amino acid sequence, and the conformation of the ligand and its orientation in the binding site. We show that our method improvements significantly increase the accuracy of designing protein–ligand interactions compared to current state-of-the-art design methods. We assess these improvements in two important tests: the first predicts mutations that change ligand-binding preferences in enzymes, and the second predicts protein sequences that bind a given ligand. In these tests, subtle conformational changes made in our model are essential to recapitulate both the results from engineering experiments and the sequence diversity occurring in natural protein families. These results therefore shed light on the mechanisms of how new protein functions might have emerged and can be engineered in the laboratory.},

We examine the performance of four freely available small molecule conformer generation tools (Balloon, Confab, Frog2, and {RDKit}) alongside a commercial tool ({MOE}). The aim of this study is 3-fold: (i) to identify which tools most accurately reproduce experimentally determined structures; (ii) to examine the diversity of the generated conformational set; and (iii) to benchmark the computational time expended. These aspects were tested using a set of 708 drug-like molecules assembled from the {OMEGA} validation set and the Astex Diverse Set. These molecules have varying physicochemical properties and at least one known X-ray crystal structure. We found that {RDKit} and Confab are statistically better than other methods at generating low rmsd conformers to the known structure. {RDKit} is particularly suited for less flexible molecules while Confab, with its systematic approach, is able to generate conformers which are geometrically closer to the experimentally determined structure for molecules with a large number of rotatable bonds (≥10). In our tests {RDKit} also resulted as the second fastest method after Frog2. In order to enhance the performance of {RDKit}, we developed a postprocessing algorithm to build a diverse and representative set of conformers which also contains a close conformer to the known structure. Our analysis indicates that, with postprocessing, {RDKit} is a valid free alternative to commercial, proprietary software.},

We present a structural ensemble of ubiquitin, refined against residual dipolar couplings ({RDCs}), comprising solution dynamics up to microseconds. The ensemble covers the complete structural heterogeneity observed in 46 ubiquitin crystal structures, most of which are complexes with other proteins. Conformational selection, rather than induced-fit motion, thus suffices to explain the molecular recognition dynamics of ubiquitin. Marked correlations are seen between the flexibility of the ensemble and contacts formed in ubiquitin complexes. A large part of the solution dynamics is concentrated in one concerted mode, which accounts for most of ubiquitin's molecular recognition heterogeneity and ensures a low entropic complex formation cost.
In solution, ubiquitin assumes all conformations seen in crystal structures of its complexes, indicating that it binds by conformational selection rather than induced fit.

Mutations in the  {SOD}1 ,  {TARDBP} , and  {FUS}  genes have been commonly identified in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ({ALS}). However, possible interactions between these {ALS}–causative genetic mutations have not been examined. Here we expressed each of three human  {FUS}  mutations (R521H, R521C, and S57Δ) in zebrafish embryos, with or without knocking down the zebrafish homolog  Fus , and observed a motor phenotype consisting of significant behavioral (touch-evoked escape response) and cellular (shortened axonal projections from motor neurons) deficits due to loss of function for the R521H and R521C mutations and/or toxic gain of function solely for the R521H mutation. Wild-type  {FUS}  could rescue the  Tardbp  knockdown phenotype, but not  vice versa , suggesting that  {TARDBP}  is upstream of  {FUS}  in this pathway responsible for motor neuron disorder. Furthermore, neither  {TARDBP}  nor  {FUS}  were able to modify and/or rescue the motor phenotype caused by mutant  {SOD}1 , and likewise  {SOD}1  failed to rescue the phenotype of zebrafish expressing mutant  {TARDBP}  or  {FUS} .

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that causes selective death of motor neurons followed by paralysis and death. A subset of {ALS} cases is caused by mutations in the gene for Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase ({SOD}1), which impart a toxic gain of function to this antioxidant enzyme. This neurotoxic property is widely believed to stem from an increased propensity to misfold and aggregate caused by decreased stability of the native homodimer or a tendency to lose stabilizing posttranslational modifications. Study of the molecular mechanisms of {SOD}1-related {ALS} has revealed a complex array of interconnected pathological processes, including glutamate excitotoxicity, dysregulation of neurotrophic factors and axon guidance proteins, axonal transport defects, mitochondrial dysfunction, deficient protein quality control, and aberrant {RNA} processing. Many of these pathologies are directly exacerbated by misfolded and aggregated {SOD}1 and/or cytosolic calcium overload, suggesting the primacy of these events in disease etiology and their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.},

Disease-linked mutations tend to destabilize the native dimeric structure of {SOD}1, and plaques containing misfolded and aggregated {SOD}1 have been found in the motor neurons of patients with {ALS}. Despite advances in understanding of {ALS} disease progression and {SOD}1 folding and stability, cytotoxic species and mechanisms remain unknown, greatly impeding the search for and design of therapeutic interventions. Here, we definitively link cytotoxicity associated with {SOD}1 aggregation in {ALS} to a nonnative trimeric {SOD}1 species. We develop methodology for the incorporation of low-resolution experimental data into simulations toward the structural modeling of metastable, multidomain aggregation intermediates. We apply this methodology to derive the structure of a {SOD}1 trimer, which we validate in vitro and in hybridized motor neurons. We show that {SOD}1 mutants designed to promote trimerization increase cell death. Further, we demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of the designed mutants correlates with trimer stability, providing a direct link between the presence of misfolded oligomers and neuron death. Identification of cytotoxic species is the first and critical step in elucidating the molecular etiology of {ALS}, and the ability to manipulate formation of these species will provide an avenue for the development of future therapeutic strategies.},

In this work, we describe a set of design principles for fusing {ncRNAs} to {RNA} aptamers to engineer allosteric {RNA} fusion molecules that modulate the activity of {ncRNAs} in a ligand-inducible way in Escherichia coli. We apply these principles to {ncRNA} regulators that can regulate translation ({IS}10 {ncRNA}) and transcription ({pT}181 {ncRNA}), and demonstrate that our design strategy exhibits high modularity between the aptamer ligand-sensing motif and the {ncRNA} target-recognition motif, which allows us to reconfigure these two motifs to engineer orthogonally acting fusion molecules that respond to different ligands and regulate different targets in the same cell. Finally, we show that the same {ncRNA} fused with different sensing domains results in a sensory-level {NOR} gate that integrates multiple input signals to perform genetic logic. These ligand-sensing {ncRNA} regulators provide useful tools to modulate the activity of structurally related families of {ncRNAs}, and building upon the growing body of {RNA} synthetic biology, our ability to design aptamer–{ncRNA} fusion molecules offers new ways to engineer ligand-sensing regulatory circuits.},

Targeted gene regulation on a genome-wide scale is a powerful strategy for interrogating, perturbing, and engineering cellular systems. Here, we develop a method for controlling gene expression based on Cas9, an {RNA}-guided {DNA} endonuclease from a type {II} {CRISPR} system. We show that a catalytically dead Cas9 lacking endonuclease activity, when coexpressed with a guide {RNA}, generates a {DNA} recognition complex that can specifically interfere with transcriptional elongation, {RNA} polymerase binding, or transcription factor binding. This system, which we call {CRISPR} interference ({CRISPRi}), can efficiently repress expression of targeted genes in Escherichia coli, with no detectable off-target effects. {CRISPRi} can be used to repress multiple target genes simultaneously, and its effects are reversible. We also show evidence that the system can be adapted for gene repression in mammalian cells. This {RNA}-guided {DNA} recognition platform provides a simple approach for selectively perturbing gene expression on a genome-wide scale.},

	abstract = {Missense mutations at protein–protein interaction sites, called interfaces, are important contributors to human disease. Interfaces are non-uniform surface areas characterized by two main regions, “core” and “rim”, which differ in terms of evolutionary conservation and physicochemical properties. Moreover, within interfaces, only a small subset of residues (“hot spots”) is crucial for the binding free energy of the protein–protein complex.

We performed a large-scale structural analysis of human single amino acid variations ({SAVs}) and demonstrated that disease-causing mutations are preferentially located within the interface core, as opposed to the rim (p \&lt; 0.01). In contrast, the interface rim is significantly enriched in polymorphisms, similar to the remaining non-interacting surface. Energetic hot spots tend to be enriched in disease-causing mutations compared to non-hot spots (p = 0.05), regardless of their occurrence in core or rim residues. For individual amino acids, the frequency of substitution into a polymorphism or disease-causing mutation differed to other amino acids and was related to its structural location, as was the type of physicochemical change introduced by the {SAV}.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated the different distribution and properties of disease-causing {SAVs} and polymorphisms within different structural regions and in relation to the energetic contribution of amino acid in protein–protein interfaces, thus highlighting the importance of a structural system biology approach for predicting the effect of {SAVs}.},

	abstract = {The accurate design of new protein–protein interactions is a longstanding goal of computational protein design. However, most computationally designed interfaces fail to form experimentally. This investigation compares five previously described successful de novo interface designs with 158 failures. Both sets of proteins were designed with the molecular modeling program Rosetta. Designs were considered a success if a high-resolution crystal structure of the complex closely matched the design model and the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding was less than 10 μM. The successes and failures represent a wide variety of interface types and design goals including heterodimers, homodimers, peptide-protein interactions, one-sided designs (i.e., where only one of the proteins was mutated) and two-sided designs. The most striking feature of the successful designs is that they have fewer polar atoms at their interfaces than many of the failed designs. Designs that attempted to create extensive sets of interface-spanning hydrogen bonds resulted in no detectable binding. In contrast, polar atoms make up more than 40\% of the interface area of many natural dimers, and native interfaces often contain extensive hydrogen bonding networks. These results suggest that Rosetta may not be accurately balancing hydrogen bonding and electrostatic energies against desolvation penalties and that design processes may not include sufficient sampling to identify side chains in preordered conformations that can fully satisfy the hydrogen bonding potential of the interface.},

A missense mutation that alters the protein binding affinity may cause significant perturbations or complete abolishment of the function, potentially leading to diseases. The availability of computational methods to evaluate the impact of mutations on protein?protein binding is critical for a wide range of biomedical applications. Here, we report an efficient computational approach for predicting the effect of single and multiple missense mutations on protein?protein binding affinity. It is based on a well-tested simulation protocol for structure minimization, modified {MM}-{PBSA} and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousands of mutations. Our simulation protocol yields very good agreement between predicted and experimental values with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.69 and 0.63 and root-mean-square errors of 1.20 and 1.90 kcal mol?1 for single and multiple mutations, respectively. Compared with other available methods, our approach achieves high speed and prediction accuracy and can be applied to large datasets generated by modern genomics initiatives. In addition, we report a crucial role of water model and the polar solvation energy in estimating the changes in binding affinity. Our analysis also reveals that prediction accuracy and effect of mutations on binding strongly depends on the type of mutation and its location in a protein complex.},

	abstract = {{ConspectusBecause} living organisms are in constant motion, the word ?dynamics? can hold many meanings to biologists. Here we focus specifically on the conformational changes that occur in proteins and how studying these protein dynamics may provide insights into enzymatic catalysis.Advances in integrating techniques such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron cryomicroscopy (cryo {EM}) allow us to model the dominant structures and exchange rates for many proteins and protein complexes. For proteins amenable to atomic resolution techniques, the major questions shift from simply describing the motions to discovering their role in function. Concurrently, there is an increasing need for using perturbations to test predictive models of dynamics?function relationships. Examples are the catalytic cycles of dihydrofolate reductase ({DHFR}) and cyclophilin A ({CypA}).In {DHFR}, mutations that alter the ability of the active site to sample productive higher energy states on the millisecond time scale reduce the rate of hydride transfer significantly. Recently identified rescue mutations restore function, but the mechanism by which they do so remains unclear. The exact role of any changes in the dynamics remains an open question. For {CypA}, a network of side chains that exchange between two conformations is critical for catalysis. Mutations that lock the network in one state also reduce catalytic activity.A further understanding of enzyme dynamics of well-studied enzymes such as dihydrofolate reductase and cyclophilin A will lead to improvement in ability to modulate the functions of computationally designed enzymes and large macromolecular machines. In designed enzymes, directed evolution experiments increase catalytic rates. Detailed X-ray studies suggest that these mutations likely limit the conformational space explored by residues in the active site. For proteins where atomic resolution information is currently inaccessible, other techniques such as cryo-{EM} and high-resolution single molecule microscopy continue to advance. Understanding the conformational dynamics of larger systems such as protein machines will likely become more accessible and provide new opportunities to rationally modulate protein function.},

Experimental expression, purification, and affinity determination of protein complexes is an expensive and time-consuming means of evaluating the effect of mutations, making a fast and accurate in silico method highly desirable. When the structure of the wild-type complex is known, it is possible to economically evaluate the effect of point mutations with knowledge based potentials, which do not model backbone flexibility, but these have been validated only for single mutants. Substitution mutations tend to induce local conformational rearrangements only. Accordingly, {ZEMu} (Zone Equilibration of Mutants) flexibilizes only a small region around the site of mutation, then computes its dynamics under a physics-based force field. We validate with 1254 experimental mutants (with 1–15 simultaneous substitutions) in a wide variety of different protein environments (65 protein complexes), and obtain a significant improvement in the accuracy of predicted ΔΔG.

For the {SH}3 domain, the backbone structure variation in the family is also better recapitulated than in randomly perturbed backbones.

	abstract = {Author {SummaryThe} goal of computational protein design is to create new protein sequences of desirable structure and biological function. Most protein design methods are developed to search for sequences with the lowest free-energy based on physics-based force fields following Anfinsen's thermodynamic hypothesis. A major obstacle of such approaches is the inaccuracy of the force-field design, which cannot accurately describe atomic interactions or correctly recognize protein folds. We propose a novel method which uses evolutionary information, in the form of sequence profiles from structure families, to guide the sequence design. Since sequence profiles are generally more accurate than physics-based potentials in protein fold recognition, a unique advantage lies on that it targets the design procedure to a family of protein sequence profiles to enhance the robustness of designed sequences. The method was tested on 87 proteins and the designed sequences can be folded by I-{TASSER} to models with an average {RMSD} 2.1 Å. As a case study of large-scale application, the method is extended to redesign all structurally resolved proteins in the human pathogenic bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Five sequences varying in fold and sizes were characterized by circular dichroism and {NMR} spectroscopy experiments and three were shown to have ordered tertiary structure.},

	abstract = {Protein engineering aimed at enhancing enzyme stability is increasingly supported by computational methods for calculation of mutant folding energies and for the design of disulfide bonds. To examine the accuracy of mutant structure predictions underlying these computational methods, crystal structures of thermostable limonene epoxide hydrolase variants obtained by computational library design were determined. Four different predicted effects indeed contributed to the obtained stabilization: (i) enhanced interactions between a flexible loop close to the N-terminus and the rest of the protein; (ii) improved interactions at the dimer interface; (iii) removal of unsatisfied hydrogen bonding groups; and (iv) introduction of additional positively charged groups at the surface. The structures of an eightfold and an elevenfold mutant showed that most mutations introduced the intended stabilizing interactions, and side-chain conformations were correctly predicted for 72–88\% of the point mutations. However, mutations that introduced a disulfide bond in a flexible region had a larger influence on the backbone conformation than predicted. The enzyme active sites were unaltered, in agreement with the observed preservation of catalytic activities. The structures also revealed how a c-Myc tag, which was introduced for facile detection and purification, can reduce access to the active site and thereby lower the catalytic activity. Finally, sequence analysis showed that comprehensive mutant energy calculations discovered stabilizing mutations that are not proposed by the consensus or B-{FIT} methods.

By studying the relaxation of the correlation function between consecutive mutations at a given position in proteins, we observe separation of the evolutionary time-scales: at short time intervals families of proteins with similar sequences and structures are formed, while at long time intervals the families of structurally similar proteins that have low sequence similarity are formed. We discuss the evolutionary implications of our model.

This paper compares strategies for computing these energies on the fly and caching computed energy values that are likely to be reused.

	abstract = {We consider the problem of loop closure, i.e., of finding the ensemble of possible backbone structures of a chain segment of a protein molecule that is geometrically consistent with preceding and following parts of the chain whose structures are given. We reduce this problem of determining the loop conformations of six torsions to finding the real roots of a 16th degree polynomial in one variable, based on the robotics literature on the kinematics of the equivalent rotator linkage in the most general case of oblique rotators. We provide a simple intuitive view and derivation of the polynomial for the case in which each of the three pair of torsional axes has a common point. Our method generalizes previous work on analytical loop closure in that the torsion angles need not be consecutive, and any rigid intervening segments are allowed between the free torsions. Our approach also allows for a small degree of flexibility in the bond angles and the peptide torsion angles; this substantially enlarges the space of solvable configurations as is demonstrated by an application of the method to the modeling of cyclic pentapeptides. We give further applications to two important problems. First, we show that this analytical loop closure algorithm can be efficiently combined with an existing loop-construction algorithm to sample loops longer than three residues. Second, we show that Monte Carlo minimization is made severalfold more efficient by employing the local moves generated by the loop closure algorithm, when applied to the global minimization of an eight-residue loop.

As a first step in evaluating the performance of this algorithm, it was applied to the problem of reconstructing loops in native protein structures. With a newly constructed test set of 89 loops ranging from 14 to 17 residues, this method obtains average/median global backbone root-mean-square deviations ({RMSDs}) to the native structure (superimposing the body of the protein, not the loop itself) of 1.46/0.68 Å. Specifically, results for loops of various lengths are 1.19/0.67 Å for 36 fourteen-residue loops, 1.55/0.75 Å for 30 fifteen-residue loops, 1.43/0.80 Å for 14 sixteen-residue loops, and 2.30/1.92 Å for nine seventeen-residue loops. In the vast majority of cases, the method locates energy minima that are lower than or equal to that of the minimized native loop, thus indicating that the new sampling method is successful and rarely limits prediction accuracy. Median {RMSDs} are substantially lower than the averages because of a small number of outliers. The causes of these failures are examined in some detail, and some can be attributed to flaws in the energy function, such as π–π interactions are not accurately accounted for by the {OPLS}-{AA} force field we employed in this study.

Rotamer libraries are used in protein structure determination, prediction, and design. The backbone-dependent rotamer library consists of rotamer frequencies, mean dihedral angles, and variances as a function of the backbone dihedral angles. Structure prediction and design methods that employ backbone flexibility would strongly benefit from smoothly varying probabilities and angles. A new version of the backbone-dependent rotamer library has been developed using adaptive kernel density estimates for the rotamer frequencies and adaptive kernel regression for the mean dihedral angles and variances. This formulation allows for evaluation of the rotamer probabilities, mean angles, and variances as a smooth and continuous function of phi and psi. Continuous probability density estimates for the nonrotameric degrees of freedom of amides, carboxylates, and aromatic side chains have been modeled as a function of the backbone dihedrals and rotamers of the remaining degrees of freedom. New backbone-dependent rotamer libraries at varying levels of smoothing are available from http://dunbrack.fccc.edu.},

	abstract = {The application of all-atom force fields (and explicit or implicit solvent models) to protein homology-modeling tasks such as side-chain and loop prediction remains challenging both because of the expense of the individual energy calculations and because of the difficulty of sampling the rugged all-atom energy surface. Here we address this challenge for the problem of loop prediction through the development of numerous new algorithms, with an emphasis on multiscale and hierarchical techniques. As a first step in evaluating the performance of our loop prediction algorithm, we have applied it to the problem of reconstructing loops in native structures; we also explicitly include crystal packing to provide a fair comparison with crystal structures. In brief, large numbers of loops are generated by using a dihedral angle-based buildup procedure followed by iterative cycles of clustering, side-chain optimization, and complete energy minimization of selected loop structures. We evaluate this method by using the largest test set yet used for validation of a loop prediction method, with a total of 833 loops ranging from 4 to 12 residues in length. Average/median backbone root-mean-square deviations ({RMSDs}) to the native structures (superimposing the body of the protein, not the loop itself) are 0.42/0.24 Å for 5 residue loops, 1.00/0.44 Å for 8 residue loops, and 2.47/1.83 Å for 11 residue loops. Median {RMSDs} are substantially lower than the averages because of a small number of outliers; the causes of these failures are examined in some detail, and many can be attributed to errors in assignment of protonation states of titratable residues, omission of ligands from the simulation, and, in a few cases, probable errors in the experimentally determined structures. When these obvious problems in the data sets are filtered out, average {RMSDs} to the native structures improve to 0.43 Å for 5 residue loops, 0.84 Å for 8 residue loops, and 1.63 Å for 11 residue loops. In the vast majority of cases, the method locates energy minima that are lower than or equal to that of the minimized native loop, thus indicating that sampling rarely limits prediction accuracy. The overall results are, to our knowledge, the best reported to date, and we attribute this success to the combination of an accurate all-atom energy function, efficient methods for loop buildup and side-chain optimization, and, especially for the longer loops, the hierarchical refinement protocol.

Applied to our newly constructed test suite of 104 loops ranging from 11 to 13 residues, our method obtains average/median global backbone root-mean-square deviations ({RMSDs}) to the native structure (superimposing the body of the protein, not the loop itself) of 1.00/0.62 Å for 11 residue loops, 1.15/0.60 Å for 12 residue loops, and 1.25/0.76 Å for 13 residue loops. Sampling errors are virtually eliminated, while energy errors leading to large backbone {RMSDs} are very infrequent compared to any previously reported efforts, including our own previous study.

	abstract = {A major limitation of current comparative modeling methods is the accuracy with which regions that are structurally divergent from homologues of known structure can be modeled. Because structural differences between homologous proteins are responsible for variations in protein function and specificity, the ability to model these differences has important functional consequences. Although existing methods can provide reasonably accurate models of short loop regions, modeling longer structurally divergent regions is an unsolved problem. Here we describe a method based on the de novo structure prediction algorithm, Rosetta, for predicting conformations of structurally divergent regions in comparative models. Initial conformations for short segments are selected from the protein structure database, whereas longer segments are built up by using three- and nine-residue fragments drawn from the database and combined by using the Rosetta algorithm. A gap closure term in the potential in combination with modified Newton's method for gradient descent minimization is used to ensure continuity of the peptide backbone. Conformations of variable regions are refined in the context of a fixed template structure using Monte Carlo minimization together with rapid repacking of side-chains to iteratively optimize backbone torsion angles and side-chain rotamers. For short loops, mean accuracies of 0.69, 1.45, and 3.62 Å are obtained for 4, 8, and 12 residue loops, respectively. In addition, the method can provide reasonable models of conformations of longer protein segments: predicted conformations of 3Å root-mean-square deviation or better were obtained for 5 of 10 examples of segments ranging from 13 to 34 residues. In combination with a sequence alignment algorithm, this method generates complete, ungapped models of protein structures, including regions both similar to and divergent from a homologous structure. This combined method was used to make predictions for 28 protein domains in the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure 4 ({CASP} 4) and 59 domains in {CASP} 5, where the method ranked highly among comparative modeling and fold recognition methods. Model accuracy in these blind predictions is dominated by alignment quality, but in the context of accurate alignments, long protein segments can be accurately modeled. Notably, the method correctly predicted the local structure of a 39-residue insertion into a {TIM} barrel in {CASP} 5 target T0186. Proteins 2004. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Comparative protein structure prediction is limited mostly by the errors in alignment and loop modeling. We describe here a new automated modeling technique that significantly improves the accuracy of loop predictions in protein structures. The positions of all nonhydrogen atoms of the loop are optimized in a fixed environment with respect to a pseudo energy function. The energy is a sum of many spatial restraints that include the bond length, bond angle, and improper dihedral angle terms from the {CHARMM}-22 force field, statistical preferences for the main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles, and statistical preferences for nonbonded atomic contacts that depend on the two atom types, their distance through space, and separation in sequence. The energy function is optimized with the method of conjugate gradients combined with molecular dynamics and simulated annealing. Typically, the predicted loop conformation corresponds to the lowest energy conformation among 500 independent optimizations. Predictions were made for 40 loops of known structure at each length from 1 to 14 residues. The accuracy of loop predictions is evaluated as a function of thoroughness of conformational sampling, loop length, and structural properties of native loops. When accuracy is measured by local superposition of the model on the native loop, 100, 90, and 30\% of 4–, 8–, and 12–residue loop predictions, respectively, had {\textless}2 Å {RMSD} error for the mainchain N, Ca, C, and O atoms; the average accuracies were 0.59 6 0.05, 1.16 6 0.10, and 2.61 6 0.16 Å, respectively. To simulate real comparative modeling problems, the method was also evaluated by predicting loops of known structure in only approximately correct environments with errors typical of comparative modeling without misalignment. When the {RMSD} distortion of the main-chain stem atoms is 2.5 Å, the average loop prediction error increased by 180, 25, and 3\% for 4–, 8–, and 12–residue loops, respectively. The accuracy of the lowest energy prediction for a given loop can be estimated from the structural variability among a number of low energy predictions. The relative value of the present method is gauged by (1) comparing it with one of the most successful previously described methods, and (2) describing its accuracy in recent blind predictions of protein structure. Finally, it is shown that the average accuracy of prediction is limited primarily by the accuracy of the energy function rather than by the extent of conformational sampling.},

	abstract = {Achieving atomic-level accuracy in comparative protein models is limited by our ability to refine the initial, homolog-derived model closer to the native state. Despite considerable effort, progress in developing a generalized refinement method has been limited. In contrast, methods have been described that can accurately reconstruct loop conformations in native protein structures. We hypothesize that loop refinement in homology models is much more difficult than loop reconstruction in crystal structures, in part, because side-chain, backbone, and other structural inaccuracies surrounding the loop create a challenging sampling problem; the loop cannot be refined without simultaneously refining adjacent portions. In this work, we single out one sampling issue in an artificial but useful test set and examine how loop refinement accuracy is affected by errors in surrounding side-chains. In 80 high-resolution crystal structures, we first perturbed 6–12 residue loops away from the crystal conformation, and placed all protein side chains in non-native but low energy conformations. Even these relatively small perturbations in the surroundings made the loop prediction problem much more challenging. Using a previously published loop prediction method, median backbone (N-Cα-C-O) {RMSD}'s for groups of 6, 8, 10, and 12 residue loops are 0.3/0.6/0.4/0.6 Å, respectively, on native structures and increase to 1.1/2.2/1.5/2.3 Å on the perturbed cases. We then augmented our previous loop prediction method to simultaneously optimize the rotamer states of side chains surrounding the loop. Our results show that this augmented loop prediction method can recover the native state in many perturbed structures where the previous method failed; the median {RMSD}'s for the 6, 8, 10, and 12 residue perturbed loops improve to 0.4/0.8/1.1/1.2 Å. Finally, we highlight three comparative models from blind tests, in which our new method predicted loops closer to the native conformation than first modeled using the homolog template, a task generally understood to be difficult. Although many challenges remain in refining full comparative models to high accuracy, this work offers a methodical step toward that goal. Proteins 2008. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {To accurately predict protein conformations in atomic detail, a computational method must be capable of sampling models sufficiently close to the native structure. All-atom sampling is difficult because of the vast number of possible conformations and extremely rugged energy landscapes. Here, we test three sampling strategies to address these difficulties: conformational diversification, intensification of torsion and omega-angle sampling and parameter annealing. We evaluate these strategies in the context of the robotics-based kinematic closure ({KIC}) method for local conformational sampling in Rosetta on an established benchmark set of 45 12-residue protein segments without regular secondary structure. We quantify performance as the fraction of sub-Angstrom models generated. While improvements with individual strategies are only modest, the combination of intensification and annealing strategies into a new “next-generation {KIC}” method yields a four-fold increase over standard {KIC} in the median percentage of sub-Angstrom models across the dataset. Such improvements enable progress on more difficult problems, as demonstrated on longer segments, several of which could not be accurately remodeled with previous methods. Given its improved sampling capability, next-generation {KIC} should allow advances in other applications such as local conformational remodeling of multiple segments simultaneously, flexible backbone sequence design, and development of more accurate energy functions.},

Here we provide a general method, a detailed set of protocols, and several benchmarks and analyses for estimating tolerated sequences using flexible backbone protein design implemented in the Rosetta molecular modeling software suite. The input to the method is at least one experimentally determined three-dimensional protein structure or high-quality model. The starting structure(s) are expanded or refined into a conformational ensemble using Monte Carlo simulations consisting of backrub backbone and side chain moves in Rosetta. The method then uses a combination of simulated annealing and genetic algorithm optimization methods to enrich for low-energy sequences for the individual members of the ensemble. To emphasize certain functional requirements (e.g. forming a binding interface), interactions between and within parts of the structure (e.g. domains) can be reweighted in the scoring function. Results from each backbone structure are merged together to create a single estimate for the tolerated sequence space. We provide an extensive description of the protocol and its parameters, all source code, example analysis scripts and three tests applying this method to finding sequences predicted to stabilize proteins or protein interfaces. The generality of this method makes many other applications possible, for example stabilizing interactions with small molecules, {DNA}, or {RNA}.

Multicellular organisms rely on complex, fine-tuned protein networks to respond to environmental changes. We used in vitro evolution to explore the role of domain mutation and expansion in the evolution of network complexity. Using random mutagenesis to facilitate family expansion, we asked how versatile and robust the binding site must be to produce the rich functional diversity of the natural {PDZ} domain family. From a combinatorial protein library, we analyzed several hundred structured domain variants and found that one-quarter were functional for carboxyl-terminal ligand recognition and that our variant repertoire was as specific and diverse as the natural family. Our results show that ligand binding is hardwired in the {PDZ} fold and suggest that this flexibility may facilitate the rapid evolution of complex protein interaction networks.},

Results: We have developed a rapid, simple and general method based on information theory that accurately estimates the level of background mutual information for each pair of positions in a given protein family. Removal of this background results in a metric, {MIp}, that correctly identifies substantially more coevolving positions in protein families than any existing method. A significant fraction of these positions coevolve strongly with one or only a few positions. The vast majority of such position pairs are in contact in representative structures. The identification of strongly coevolving position pairs can be used to impose significant structural limitations and should be an important additional constraint for ab initio protein folding.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0011082},
	abstract = {Background
There is currently no way to verify the quality of a multiple sequence alignment that is independent of the assumptions used to build it. Sequence alignments are typically evaluated by a number of established criteria: sequence conservation, the number of aligned residues, the frequency of gaps, and the probable correct gap placement. Covariation analysis is used to find putatively important residue pairs in a sequence alignment. Different alignments of the same protein family give different results demonstrating that covariation depends on the quality of the sequence alignment. We thus hypothesized that current criteria are insufficient to build alignments for use with covariation analyses.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We show that current criteria are insufficient to build alignments for use with covariation analyses as systematic sequence alignment errors are present even in hand-curated structure-based alignment datasets like those from the Conserved Domain Database. We show that current non-parametric covariation statistics are sensitive to sequence misalignments and that this sensitivity can be used to identify systematic alignment errors. We demonstrate that removing alignment errors due to 1) improper structure alignment, 2) the presence of paralogous sequences, and 3) partial or otherwise erroneous sequences, improves contact prediction by covariation analysis. Finally we describe two non-parametric covariation statistics that are less sensitive to sequence alignment errors than those described previously in the literature.

Conclusions/Significance
Protein alignments with errors lead to false positive and false negative conclusions (incorrect assignment of covariation and conservation, respectively). Covariation analysis can provide a verification step, independent of traditional criteria, to identify systematic misalignments in protein alignments. Two non-parametric statistics are shown to be somewhat insensitive to misalignment errors, providing increased confidence in contact prediction when analyzing alignments with erroneous regions because of an emphasis on they emphasize pairwise covariation over group covariation.},

The lowest free energy sequences obtained for ensembles of native-like backbone structures were also similar to the native sequence. Furthermore, both the individual residue frequencies and the covariances between pairs of positions observed in the very large {SH}3 domain family were recapitulated in core sequences designed for {SH}3 domain structures.

We illustrate how Rosetta simulations that apply backrub moves improve modeling of point mutant side-chain conformations, native side-chain conformational heterogeneity, functional conformational changes, tolerated sequence space, protein interaction specificity, and amino acid covariation across protein–protein interfaces. We include relevant Rosetta command lines and {RosettaScripts} to encourage the application of these types of simulations to other systems. Our work highlights that critical scoring and sampling improvements will be necessary to approximate conformational landscapes. Challenges for the future development of these methods include modeling conformational changes that propagate away from designed mutation sites and modulating backbone flexibility to predictively design functionally important conformational heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryProteins} generally fold into specific three-dimensional structures to perform their cellular functions, and the presence of misfolded proteins is often deleterious for cellular and organismal fitness. For these reasons, maintenance of protein structure is thought to be one of the major fitness pressures acting on proteins. Consequently, the sequences of today's naturally occurring proteins contain signatures reflecting the constraints imposed by protein structure. Here we test the ability of computational protein design methods to recapitulate and explain these signatures. We focus on the physical basis of evolutionary pressures that act on interactions between amino acids in folded proteins, which are critical in determining protein structure and function. Such pressures can be observed from the appearance of amino acid covariation, where the amino acids at certain positions in protein sequences are correlated with each other. We find similar patterns of amino acid covariation in natural sequences and sequences optimized for their structures using computational protein design, demonstrating the importance of structural constraints in protein molecular evolution and providing insights into the structural mechanisms leading to covariation. In addition, these results characterize the ability of computational methods to model the precise details of correlated amino acid changes, which is critical for engineering new proteins with useful functions beyond those seen in nature.},

Protein-protein interactions are key components of all signal transduction processes, so methods to alter these interactions promise to become important tools in dissecting function of connectivities in these networks. We have developed a fast computational approach for the prediction of energetically important amino acid residues in protein-protein interfaces (available at http://robetta.bakerlab.org/alaninescan), which we, following Peter Kollman, have termed "computational alanine scanning." The input consists of a three-dimensional structure of a protein-protein complex; output is a list of "hot spots," or amino acid side chains that are predicted to significantly destabilize the interface when mutated to alanine, analogous to the results of experimental alanine-scanning mutagenesis. 79\% of hot spots and 68\% of neutral residues were correctly predicted in a test of 233 mutations in 19 protein-protein complexes. A single interface can be analyzed in minutes. The computational methodology has been validated by the successful design of protein interfaces with new specificity and activity, and has yielded new insights into the mechanisms of receptor specificity and promiscuity in biological systems.},

Based on our previous method ({KFC}), we present two new methods ({KFC}2a and {KFC}2b) that outperform other methods at hot spot prediction. A number of improvements were made in developing these new methods. First, we created a training data set that contained a similar number of hot spot and non-hot spot residues. In addition, we generated 47 different features, and different numbers of features were used to train the models to avoid over-fitting. Finally, two feature combinations were selected: One (used in {KFC}2a) is composed of eight features that are mainly related to solvent accessible surface area and local plasticity; the other ({KFC}2b) is composed of seven features, only two of which are identical to those used in {KFC}2a. The two models were built using support vector machines ({SVM}). The two {KFC}2 models were then tested on a mixed independent test set, and compared with other methods such as Robetta, {FOLDEF}, {HotPoint}, {MINERVA}, and {KFC}. {KFC}2a showed the highest predictive accuracy for hot spot residues (True Positive Rate: {TPR} = 0.85); however, the false positive rate was somewhat higher than for other models. {KFC}2b showed the best predictive accuracy for hot spot residues (True Positive Rate: {TPR} = 0.62) among all methods other than {KFC}2a, and the False Positive Rate ({FPR} = 0.15) was comparable with other highly predictive methods.

In principle, given the structure of a wild-type protein and a point mutation whose effects are to be predicted, an accurate method should recapitulate both the structural changes and the change in the folding-free energy. Here, we explore the performance of protocols which sample an increasing diversity of conformations. We find that surprisingly similar performances in predicting changes in stability are achieved using protocols that involve very different amounts of conformational sampling, provided that the resolution of the force field is matched to the resolution of the sampling method. Methods involving backbone sampling can in some cases closely recapitulate the structural changes accompanying mutations but not surprisingly tend to do more harm than good in cases where structural changes are negligible. Analysis of the outliers in the stability change calculations suggests areas needing particular improvement; these include the balance between desolvation and the formation of favorable buried polar interactions, and unfolded state modeling.

Our analysis shows that at the level of side-chains there is little correlation between buried surface area and free energy of binding. We find that the free energy of binding is not evenly distributed across interfaces; instead, there are hot spots of binding energy made up of a small subset of residues in the dimer interface. These hot spots are enriched in tryptophan, tyrosine and arginine, and are surrounded by energetically less important residues that most likely serve to occlude bulk solvent from the hot spot. Occlusion of solvent is found to be a necessary condition for highly energetic interactions.},

Biol. 2003, 326, 1239] used by the molecular modeling program Rosetta and then combined it with a distance-dependent Coulomb model of electrostatics. The functional form of the H-bond potential is physically motivated and parameters are fit so that H-bond geometries that Rosetta generates closely resemble H-bond geometries in high-resolution crystal structures.

We evaluated their performance on a large set of 2156 single mutations, avoiding for each program the mutations used for training. The correlation coefficients between experimental and predicted ΔΔG values were in the range of 0.59 for the best and 0.26 for the worst performing method.

This is not due to lack in precision of the experimental data, which showed a correlation coefficient of 0.86 between different measurements. Combining the methods did not significantly improve prediction accuracy compared to a single method.

	abstract = {This article is an introduction to the special issue of the journal {PROTEINS}, dedicated to the tenth Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction ({CASP}) experiment to assess the state of the art in protein structure modeling. The article describes the conduct of the experiment, the categories of prediction included, and outlines the evaluation and assessment procedures. The 10 {CASP} experiments span almost 20 years of progress in the field of protein structure modeling, and there have been enormous advances in methods and model accuracy in that period. Notable in this round is the first sustained improvement of models with refinement methods, using molecular dynamics. For the first time, we tested the ability of modeling methods to make use of sparse experimental three-dimensional contact information, such as may be obtained from new experimental techniques, with encouraging results. On the other hand, new contact prediction methods, though holding considerable promise, have yet to make an impact in {CASP} testing. The nature of {CASP} targets has been changing in recent {CASPs}, reflecting shifts in experimental structural biology, with more irregular structures, more multi-domain and multi-subunit structures, and less standard versions of known folds. When allowance is made for these factors, we continue to see steady progress in the overall accuracy of models, particularly resulting from improvement of non-template regions.

However, such models require empirical training data and proper validation before they can be widely applied. Previous databases contained few stabilizing mutations and no discussion of their inherent biases or how this impacts model construction or validation.
Results: We present {SKEMPI}, a database of 3047 binding free energy changes upon mutation assembled from the scientific literature, for protein–protein heterodimeric complexes with experimentally determined structures. This represents over four times more data than previously collected. Changes in 713 association and dissociation rates and 127 enthalpies and entropies were also recorded. The existence of biases towards specific mutations, residues, interfaces, proteins and protein families is discussed in the context of how the data can be used to construct predictive models. Finally, a cross-validation scheme is presented which is capable of estimating the efficacy of derived models on future data in which these biases are not present.

	abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is one of the most frequent problems in biology. This task is usually facilitated by accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program {MODELLER} and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis ({TvLDH}) is described as an example. The download and installation of the {MODELLER} software is also described. Curr. Protoc.

The alanine scan revealed a cluster of a dozen large side chains that when mutated to alanine each showed more than a four times lower binding affinity to the {hGH} receptor. Many of these residues that promote binding to the {hGH} receptor are altered in homologs of {hGH} (such as placental lactogens and prolactins) that do not bind tightly to the {hGH} receptor. The overall folding of these mutant proteins was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type {hGH}, as determined by strong cross-reactivities with seven different conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibodies.

We used bulk competition and focused deep sequencing to investigate the effects of all ubiquitin point mutants on yeast growth rate. Many aspects of ubiquitin function have been carefully studied, which enabled interpretation of our growth analyses in light of a rich structural, biophysical and biochemical knowledge base. In one highly sensitive cluster on the surface of ubiquitin, almost every amino acid substitution caused growth defects. In contrast, the opposite face tolerated virtually all possible substitutions. Surface locations between these two faces exhibited intermediate mutational tolerance. The sensitive face corresponds to the known interface for many binding partners. Across all surface positions, we observe a strong correlation between burial at structurally characterized interfaces and the number of amino acid substitutions compatible with robust growth. This result indicates that binding is a dominant determinant of ubiquitin function. In the solvent-inaccessible core of ubiquitin, all positions tolerated a limited number of substitutions, with hydrophobic amino acids especially interchangeable. Some mutations null for yeast growth were previously shown to populate folded conformations indicating that, for these mutants, subtle changes to conformation caused functional defects. The most sensitive region to mutation within the core was located near the C-terminus that is a focal binding site for many critical binding partners. These results indicate that core mutations may frequently cause functional defects through subtle disturbances to structure or dynamics.},

The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the {RHF}/6-31G*//{RHF}/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

	abstract = {{CHARMM} (Chemistry at {HARvard} Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. The {CHARMM} program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with {CHARMM} can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original {CHARMM} article in 1983. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.J Comput Chem, 2009.},

The association energy is described as the sum of two solvation terms and an energy term to account for the loss of translational and rotational entropy. The calculated solvation energy, using atomic solvation parameters and the solvent accessible surface areas, has a correlation of 96\% with experimentally determined values. We have applied this methodology to examine intermediates in viral assembly and to assess the contribution isomerization makes to the association energy of molecular complexes. In addition, we have shown that the calculated association can be used as a predictive tool for analyzing modeled molecular complexes.},

Although the structures of many protein–protein complexes have been solved in molecular detail, general rules describing affinity and selectivity of protein–protein interactions do not accurately account for the extremely diverse nature of the interfaces. We investigate the extent to which a simple physical model can account for the wide range of experimentally measured free energy changes brought about by alanine mutation at protein–protein interfaces. The model successfully predicts the results of alanine scanning experiments on globular proteins (743 mutations) and 19 protein–protein interfaces (233 mutations) with average unsigned errors of 0.81 kcal/mol and 1.06 kcal/mol, respectively. The results test our understanding of the dominant contributions to the free energy of protein–protein interactions, can guide experiments aimed at the design of protein interaction inhibitors, and provide a stepping-stone to important applications such as interface redesign.},

We describe a massively parallel approach for designing, manufacturing and screening mini-protein binders, integrating large-scale computational design, oligonucleotide synthesis, yeast display screening and next-generation sequencing. We designed and tested 22,660 mini-proteins of 37–43 residues that target influenza haemagglutinin and botulinum neurotoxin B, along with 6,286 control sequences to probe contributions to folding and binding, and identified 2,618 high-affinity binders. Comparison of the binding and non-binding design sets, which are two orders of magnitude larger than any previously investigated, enabled the evaluation and improvement of the computational model. Biophysical characterization of a subset of the binder designs showed that they are extremely stable and, unlike antibodies, do not lose activity after exposure to high temperatures. The designs elicit little or no immune response and provide potent prophylactic and therapeutic protection against influenza, even after extensive repeated dosing.},
