Computational predicting changes in binding free energy of protein-protein interfaces after mutation allows these interactions to be designed and predicted in high throughput.
We have developed a method to predict these interface $\Delta\Delta G$s
Considering natural conformational plasticity could be helpful.
We developed a method to do this in Rosetta, using backrub based conformational sampling.
On a benchmark set of 1240 mutants, we measured performance, and were able to do better leading Rosetta methods.
On the subset of small to large, even better.
Considering flexibility was important, as a control method had a worse performance.
Averaging across more structures also improved performance.
Maching learning score function fitting also might show how the Rosetta energy function can be improved in the future.
