  \caption[]{ % Old short caption: Flex ddG performance vs. number of averaged structures for flex ddG
    Correlation (Pearson's R, left y-axis) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error, right y-axis) vs. number of averaged structures (x-axis), on the complete ZEMu set, and subsets.
    Pearson's R is shown with circular points, and MAE with faded plus-shaped points.
    Predictions generated with the Flex ddG protocol are shown in blue.
    Predictions generated with the no backrub control protocol are shown in green.
