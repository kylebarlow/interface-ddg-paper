    Correlation (Pearson's R, left y-axis) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error, right y-axis) vs. number of averaged structures (x-axis), on the complete ZEMu set, and subsets.
    Pearson's R is shown with circular points, and MAE with faded plus-shaped points.
    Predictions generated with the Flex ddG protocol are shown in blue.
    Predictions generated with the no backrub control protocol are shown in green.
    A selection of key data underlying this figure can be found in \cref{tab:structs-v-corr-WildTypeComplex-zemu-12-60000-rscript-validated-t14-underlying-data}.
    Structures are sorted by their minimized wild-type complex energy.
    (a) Complete dataset (n = 1240, backrub steps = 35000)
    (b) Small-to-large mutation(s) (n = 130, backrub steps = 35000)
    (c) Multiple mutations, none to alanine (n = 45, backrub steps = 35000)
    (d) Single mutation to alanine (n = 748, backrub steps = 35000)
