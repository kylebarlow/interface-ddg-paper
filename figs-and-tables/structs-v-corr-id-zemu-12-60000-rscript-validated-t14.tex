    Correlation (Pearson's R) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) vs. number of averaged structures, on the complete ZEMu set, and subsets. Structures are not sorted, and are randomly added to the ensemble. 
    (a) Complete dataset (n = 1240, backrub steps = 35000)
    (b) Small-to-large mutation(s) (n = 130, backrub steps = 35000)
    (c) Multiple mutations, none alanine (n = 45, backrub steps = 35000)
    (d) Single mutation to alanine (n = 748, backrub steps = 35000)
