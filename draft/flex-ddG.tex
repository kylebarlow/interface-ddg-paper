A good benchmarking set is important to test a new method. Skempi \cite{moal_skempi:_2012} is the largest known database, but is not curated to be maximally effective for method development and benchmarking. Because experimental methods can have a strong effect on the performance of predictors of changes in binding free energy\cite{geng_exploring_2016}, some filtering of the entire universe of known mutations is necessary. To prevent overfitting, we have chosen to use the dataset used by ZEMU \cite{dourado_multiscale_2014}, which filtered by x, y, and z.
